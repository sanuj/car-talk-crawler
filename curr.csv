Worth considering if nothing else crops up  but the problem with the fuel injector theory is the symptom for that usually first appears during slow speed driving  5-10 mph  accelerating from slow speed turns  etc. CG above is correct of course to let the dealership handle this problem if the warranty remains in effect.

I was looking at my drive belt and pulleys with the engine running yesterday and noticed the crankshaft pulley/harmonic balancer wobbling.Should I be worried or a little wobble is normal?17

On one of mine it sheared the crank sensor and the car was dead. On another pretty new Buick it caused a leak from the front seal. So yeah  a wobble is not normal and the balancer needs to be replaced. Last time it cost me close to $500.

Never heard anyone replacing a balancer before either.Can a DIYer replace it? I know you need a pulley kit to take it off and put it back.

Then use a breaker bar on on the crankshaft bolt.

Some of the techniques in the video will likely work as well. It all depends on the torque value you need for the crank bolt.

I tried various ways to hold the thing like an improvised strap but nothing worked because the timing chain was off. I had to pull the pan anyway so I ended up wedging a block on the crank to hold it while I got the bolt off. I don’t think I would have had a problem with the timing chain intact but that was a GM.

To hold it still while I removed the crank bolt  I noticed there were two small holes 180 degrees apart on the face of the pulley. I made myself a sturdy wooden stick using plywood with two wood screws through it  that matched the spacing of the holes. Then I wedged that stick against the ground in an orientation to prevent the pulley from rotating. Crank bolt removed easy-peasy with a socket & breaker bar. There’s a tool called a “pin tool” you can buy that does that same thing. But my wooden stick home-made method worked fine for me.One thing to be careful about  when pulling the pulley from the crankshaft using a puller  first install the bolt back in-- but not tight – then use the head of the bolt to push on with the center of the puller. What you have to be careful about  remember to monitor the pulley while doing this  so that it doesn’t meet up with the head of the bolt. If that happens and you continue to pull on it with the puller something expensive will break.I’ve seen ideas in magazines where a diy’er – to remove the bolt – will remove the starter motor and wedge something against the flywheel teeth to hold the crankshaft steady also. Seems like that would work  but removing the starter motor is a pretty big job sometimes. (Just noticed this idea already posted above  sorry for the repeat.)For a quick tutorial on how the harmonic balancer works and ways it can fail  click below.http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/273 3

Is this the tool you are referring to?Apparently  removing to the starter motor is not as difficult as I thought. You can access it from above in a Mazda 6. That’s the flywheel ring gear exposed in the image below.I have lots of wood here that I can use for this. I can try your method. Thanks!

For that tool to work the two holes it grabs obviously have to be present. Does your crank pulley sport those two holes? If so  that’s a good method for a diy’er.

At any rate if it’s the six  Rockauto has a repair bushing for about $6  compared to $44 for the pulley. For some reason the one for the 4 is $170. That’s the extent of what I know. Maybe a mechanic can shed some light on it.

But it was running fine before I shut it off went to start it about 30 min later and would just sit and crank  that’s why I think the ICM got to hot and then possibly shorted out the ignition coil as well. I am going to test the ignition coil for a spark today after work.

The wifemobile has a naturally aspirated 6 cyl engine while you have a different engine. Yours is a 4 cyl engine with a turbocharger.My experience with BMWs is that my two 1997 328s would burn anything you put in them. They just retarded the timing and ran smoothly with regular fuel (albiet with slightly less power).My two 2004 BMWs were more particular. If I put regular or midgrade in them  they kept trying to readjust back to normal timing every time there was no load  and then pinging for a split second and adjusting back whenever I accelerated.

So  yes  you can use regular gasoline if you want to. The manual also says that you may hear knock on hot starts  but it will not damage the engine.

Everything is in good shape but I want to keep it that way. My previous car had leather seats but after 15 years the leather split in places  wore through in others.What is a good leather maintenance I can use to keep the seats in good shape? I remember a few years ago  someone posted about a good product that you slather all over the seats in hot weather and let bake in the sun over a weekend. Since we are now in August  that might be timely. However  something else may be better.I’m all ears!6

Look at it this way… if you had bought the #4 rated vehicle–the Honda HR-V–you would be REALLY unhappy with that vehicle’s truly excessive interior noise level.As I suggested earlier  if you really like everything else about the car  then it might be worthwhile for you to have Dynamat sound insulation installed.

I was told it could be the rear differential  at a repair cost of up to $1 400.00. IF that did not stop the noise  then they would open and examine the transfer case. If the transfer case needed repair it could cost up to $2 200.00. IF that did not fix it  then it could be the transmission  of which replacement is not recommended. Am I nuts  or does this seem like it came from Mars? I’m going to continue to drive it until I either figure out where the noise is coming from  or if and when the noise becomes continuous and is easier to pinpoint. When I’m going straight  or turning a corner at a slow speed  there is no noise. BTW  the dealer charged me $140.00 for their diagnosis.

If the noise only occurs on right turns  and seems to be coming from the front end of the car  but not on left turns  seems unlikely a transfer case or differential problem. I have no experience with that make/model mind you  but where I’d focus is a problem on the left side of the car. Wheel bearing  axle shaft (cv joints)  or looks for marks where the wheel is rubbing against the fender liner  etc. My guess the problem is the left axle inner cv joint. Check the boot  see if it has split.

Then  I took my Nitro to a privately owned repair shop where they found and repaired the problem. It was a loose heat shield that moved over during right turns and touched the driveshaft. It cost me $97.50 total to have it repaired. Now  to confront the dealer about their bogus estimate. I think the dealer’s tech didn’t even try to figure out where the noise was coming from.

Most other people thumbs up  down or comment. If I stated that it was Nickson part no 17149 from Advance Auto Parts then its on the fence if its a promo or a suggested fix. Then bloggers could (as ive seen on other sites) comment how effective part no 17149 was on their application. But yet you wish to discount any non-commercially engineered fix and elicit the website administrator to remove my contribution. It took a lot of hard work to develop my fix. Perhaps made in China label suits you Mr. Volvo_V70…or USA via Germany as with Volvos and other automotive manufacturers. The removal of my post disregards American ingenuity. We Americans can not compete because others are so bothered by the positive inclinations of our neighbors that they overtly sabotage progress. Shame on you. I do hope this honest conveyance is seen as productive criticism that adds to the conversation on this thread.

124893,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2011-ford-suv-mysterious-coolant-leak/124893,2011 FORD SUV Mysterious coolant leak,Maintenance/Repairs,||pathfinder||nissan||,1,9969517_142053,Hi everyone  My car has been losing coolant slowly for months without visible leak anywhere  overheating  oil in coolant  milky oil  sweet smell and bubble in recovery tank. The coolant level in tank droped about 1cm every 30-40 miles driving in average. Coolant level kept lowering even after it was below MIN marking. There is minor condensation on under-side of oil fill cap  it always reappears few days after I clean it  does this show a very minor water or coolant keeps going into oil? But oil from dipstick looks clear and clean. 3 minutes after cold start  much damp white smoke and a few drips keep coming out from tailpipe for about 15 minutes then completely disappear after engine completely warms up. Every time when I remove the overflow tank cap with completely cold engine  I can hear a popping sound that seems like some air in coolant system escaping out. Does this show a small pressure from engine is leaking to coolant system? For pressure test  the coolant system can hold 18 psi pressure very well for more than 5 hours with cold engine. When I kept connecting pressure tester to overflow tank and started engine without pumping pressure  the pressure on gauge didn’t increase quickly  stayed at 5 psi after engine warmed up  then I pumped it to 15 psi  it slowly went up to 19 at most after 1 hour idling  and finally when engine got cold I saw coolant level was 0.5cm lower (or about 5oz less) than it was before this test. But I still did not see any external leak. Moreover  the recovery tank cap has been changed  the dealer also checked transmission pan and spark plug  and did TK test (combustion gas detection)   they couldn’t find the leak too. I’m at a loss. Any suggestion? Could it be a very small and early stage blown head gasket or head crack without obvious symptoms?There comes a new clue. As I mentioned  after 1 hour high pressure test with engine idling yesterday  coolant level droped 0.5cm. Today I started my car and just leave it idling for half hours without pumping additional pressure  after engine was cold  I saw the coolant level still droped about 0.5cm. So no matter the engine was running for 1 hour or half hours  and no matter there was high pressure or normal pressure in coolant system  my car lost the same amount of coolant. It seems the car loses coolant only in the first half hour after engine cold start. What can be the cause?12

Or do you mean 50 000 miles? If the latter  just monitor the coolant level and top up as necessary. If that’s all you are losing  nothing else needs to be done until/unless it gets worse.

Thanks for clarifying. Definitely requires investigation what’s causing it. It sounds like your shop has done all the right things. The spark plug tips show no signs of being steamed cleaned? And there’s no mayonnaise looking stuff on the under-side of the oil fill cap? Are you able to drive for long distances at freeway speeds w/no signs of overheating? And no overheating in stop and go driving and while waiting in line for fast food? If so you’ll probably just have to monitor the situation. Eventually whatever’s broke will fail more  and in a way that will provide a clear diagnosis. Hopefully it’s an external leak that’s currently hidden for some reason  and easily repaired.Another idea might be to do a shop test for combustion products in the coolant.

Only some condensation on under side of oil fill cap  but it is strange that even if I clean the condensation it always reappears after driving. Does that mean there is always a very minor water leaking into oil? And the engine is never overheating both when freeway driving and city driving. It does not really matter that I need to add coolant constantly because of a small external leak  but I am worried the engine would be slowly damaged if it is a internal leak. Do you mean the test for combustion products is to use a solution to detected combustion gas in coolant? The dealer guys call it TK test  already done. So I think maybe a inernal leak is so small that there is not enough combustion gas leaking into coolant system to be detected.

The combustion of gasoline produces nearly as much water as there was gasoline burned. Most of the water exits the tail pipe as water vapor  but some liquid water gets into the crankcase and mixes w/the oil. So there’s always a little water in the oil  unless you drive mostly long distances on the freeway. That sort of driving evaporates most of the water out. Suggest to read this week’s “Ask Car Talk”  which Ray talks about this very subject. Click cartalk.com upper left. I’ve never noticed any condensation on the underside of my oil caps  but then again I’ve never looked specifically for that. I’m checking for anything really unusual looking there  something that looks like mayonnaise  which is a clear sign of large amounts of water or coolant in the oil. You don’t seem to have that problem. Which is good news. If you are able to  open the radiator cap (not just the expansion bottle) and see if you notice any oil floating on top. Given what you say  I doubt you will. Which again is good news. [ TK test  already done. ] Yes  that tested for exhaust gasses in the coolant. Negative means more good news.Since nobody has any idea where the coolant is going  you’ll just have to continue to monitor the situation. If the coolant loss starts to get worse  or you notice other symptoms  take it back to the shop.Another idea  some people – especially women – have a much better sense of smell than the rest of us. One time after I had installed a new gas range I had a co-worker that I asked to come to my apartment and use her nose to test if she smelled any natural gas odor. I thought I might be smelling something  but not sure. She said right away “no  everything is fine  no odor”. And she was correct. So if you know someone like that  ask them to smell for any coolant odor after you take your car for a drive. In the engine compartment  passenger compartment  or elsewhere.

After testing them for performance new  staff members keep them and report on their lifetime experience. I think they do a good job  but I’m no expert.Tires come with NHTSA ratings  one of them an expected-mileage number. I used to get a flyer from a local tire store that advertised incredibly cheap tires ($17!). I looked up the ratings and the expected-mileage numbers were really low  some as low as a fifth of the highest-rated tires. I thought of them as rip-offs. Now that I drive 100 miles annually and know tires don’t last forever  even unused  I can see how they would be useful to some - provided that the low lifetime didn’t also mean that they’re flimsy.

I often looked at the tires on farmer’s wagons and were amazed at their bald and cracked condition. They always buy used whatever the tire shop has got handy cheap. They just sit in the field most of the time. My FIL once was talking about tires on the farm and he said he counted something like 140 tires that he had on various devices. So I guess whatever fits your needs. Good used tires would actually make more sense except when you factor in the cost of mounting and balancing and costs more than the tires.

They were doing logging on the 1 lane dirt road to the launch. Stopped at a potential turn around for the logging operation  to see what the rest of the road looked like as it was at the top of a hill. Soft sand ruts 8" deep at least on the hill. I was I am bailing we could get down  maybe get up  probably I could beg a heavy equipment guy to tow us up if needed. So I had a small turn around area  not well groomed all sand  dragged the boat up with 4wd  all four tires spinning and kicking up sand smoke  wife overwatching it is a 2 foot drop for the trailer to the trail  f it I’m going downhill  the trailer and spare mounted underneath were not happy but that is the most extensive use of 4wd under adverse conditions I ever had. Got out of there  may need to go back in sept  want a lakefront property but the only way to see it is if they repair the public launch road.

If it’s treadwear  that would not inure to the benefit of someone who drives as rarely as I do. My Goodrich Premiers have a treadwear of 60K miles - I’ve put only 20K on them.If it’s load index  that no longer matters because I’m not going to move back to the country or renovate my house extensively anymore.The lowest speed rating  ‘S’  is for 112. I never exceed 75.Even temperature probably doesn’t matter because I don’t drive fast and I can’t tolerate driving for more than an hour at a stretch anymore. I carry a book and water and snacks if I may be out longer and look for nice places to take a break.I don’t want to reënact the chase scene from Bullitt  just avoid a pile-up on the Interstate.
123136,https://community.cartalk.com/t/best-place-for-tire-brand-advice/123136,Best place for tire brand advice?,Maintenance/Repairs,||corolla||toyota||,77,Mustangman,The price of a tire is not just treadwear  nor temperature resistance nor load capability. All these performance characteristics are tested when the tires are new. The long term safety part comes in the quality of construction  the materials used and their ability to age well. A cheap tire that passes load  speed and temperature out of the mold will likely degrade far faster than another  more expensive tire. Wear tests are accelerated and don’t include 4  6 or 10 years aging to the tire. Just meeting DOT specs doesn’t mean the tire will age well  not throw the tread  break the cords or blow out.And temperature IS an issue with you. Ambient temperature affects tires. An hour’s drive down the highway is plenty to allow the tire to increase its temperature to a stable  but higher level. Rubber is affected by temperature  the weight of the tire puts stress on the cords which are bonded by the rubber. That cheap tire you bought today may just explode 2 or 3 years down the road in the exact same conditions the tire saw when new.The way you use a tire  it will age out long before it wears out. That cheap tire that meets your performance specs today won’t 3 years from today. A quality (and more costly) tire may still be serviceable at 6 or even 10 years.

I meant to point out that I don’t want to pay for virtues that are valuable to others but not to me. Load-bearing means a lot to someone who carries a lot of weight. I’ve done that in the past  even overloaded it (with a load of gravel  burst a tire  had to unload the gravel to replace the wheel… grrrrrr!!! ) but I don’t do that anymore and don’t think I ever will. [ Wear tests are accelerated and don’t include 4  6 or 10 years aging to the tire. ] People have argued elsewhere that I shouldn’t keep a tire longer than a few years no matter how good the tread is. How well it holds up at 10 years doesn’t matter if I replace them every 5. I bought tires rated for 60K miles 16 years ago. I’ve put 20K on them. If I have to discard them now just because they’re old  how well they age isn’t so valuable. [ A quality (and more costly) tire may still be serviceable at 6 or even 10 years. ] Elsewhere people have told me not to keep any tire for 10 years. My 16-year-old tires look good  both tread and sidewalls. They hold pressure well. Even the 20-year-old Firestone looks good and holds air. It’s never been a dream ride but it feels the same to me.

The truck ran great for about the first week then one night I was driving and it overheated severely and started running really rough. It had blown a head gasket… at least that’s what I think due to the large amount of white smoke coming out of the exhaust while running. I repaired that and put GM certified coolant in it. Yesterday I was taking a short drive and noticed a burning oil smell and it was just starting to go over the 210 degree mark on the temp gauge. I made it home and checked the oil. When I pulled the dipstick a decent amount of smoke came out of the dipstick tube that just had a distinct burnt smell. It didn’t even smell like oil. And there was barely any oil on the dipstick so I added the proper amount of 5-w30. Why could there be smoke coming out of the dipstick tube and why is it still getting hot?10

You may have replaced the head gasket  but did you take the heads to a shop to determine if they needed machining. This is important because without the heads being perfectly flat  the gasket will never seal the high combustion pressures.Yosemite

The original error code I got was P1518 which lead me to find that my IMCR was missing a plastic bushing that connected the metal rods to the engine. I replaced it and put the manifold back on and reconnected everything but the engine continues to stall after running for a few minutes from a cold start. I connected my code reader and the codes I got back were P0122 and P1504. Any information on how to fix the problems associated with these codes without taking my car to an expensive repair shop would be appreciated.

I’ve had vacuum leaks cause that symptom on my truck though. Those are the two places I’d look first if it were my car. Beyond the other ideas above  a faulty throttle position sensor could be another – less likely – cause. My guess is that if this car possesses an idle air control valve  that’s the problem. That’s what that part mainly does  control the idle speed during warm up. It has no effect once the engine has reached operating temperature. So the symptoms are mostly consistent with that part being the problem. The main problem w/this theory is that usually a shop would clean and check the operation of the idle air control valve as part of a throttle body service. So OP should ask if that was done or not.

They did the “self-learn” on the IAC and reprogrammed the MAS again. Now I’ve got the car back to see if I can locate a remanufactured ECM - the next best guess in the progression. Not about to plunk down for a new ECM through Infiniti - that would be almost what I paid for the car! Still don’t plan to shoot it  but the block heater may still be on the table if this doesn’t work! Any other ideas while I move forward with this next step?

Catalytic converters aren’t designed to handle raw gasoline. If you could disable the fuel supply to that cylinder  then it might work  but the engine would be unbalanced & that would probably create a very noticeable vibration.

I believe the Chrysler NGC module is capable of this  Isn’t it?

It wouldn’t hurt to take it to a shop for a diagnosis to be sure it’s nothing else and to get a best guess on how long you might be able to drive it before it dies on you somewhere. If it does die and you decide to replace the engine  this will be an expensive (and unnecessary) situation  I’m afraid.

You can try to add a can of Restore (Walmart  Advance  AutoZone etc carry it) to the oil. If may quiet the noise  it might not. Your engine may last another week  month or year  no way to tell. I bet it starts to burn oil  all the more reason to check the oil more frequently. It may have already been burning oil which is why is was so low.

Here is my view: The larger shoe should go forward  not rearward. Remember: Bolted together as one cohesive part  are the rear-wheel  brake-drum and axle-shaft. When the brakes are applied it is that cohesive part that brutally grabs at the road - an action that forces this wheel/drum/axle-shaft assembly to violently leap relatively rearward - pressing the inner surface of the brake drum most-so upon the forward-facing shoe. Ergo: The proper place for the larger shoe is forward. Christopher Baer33

This “turning” action puts additional forces on the rear shoe. So if the rear shoe is larger  you get better stopping power.I grew up with this being the “accepted practice” everywhere I worked  and it always made sense to me. I never saw any design docs for brakes to know if they were designed that way.
40531,https://community.cartalk.com/t/drum-brakes-location-of-larger-shoe/40531,Drum Brakes > Location of Larger Shoe,Maintenance/Repairs,||valves||cutlass||brakes||oldsmobile||,4,MikeInNH,For years I always put the large shoe on the front. Every car I worked on the large shoe was in the front. Then I changed the brakes on my 90 Pathfinder…and the large shoe was in the rear…So I guess it depends on the vehicle…or really doesn’t matter.

I don’t know if that’s changed.BINGO - I found this on the net (and several other places  but this is a good quote)  at least it’s consistent with my memory: “Automotive brake shoes consist of a primary and secondary shoe. The primary brake shoe is the front shoe and normally has a slightly shorter lining than the secondary shoe. The secondary shoe is the rear shoe and has the largest lining surface area.”

The shorter lining goes in front. The front shoe helps to servo the rear one. The lining is usually thicker on the front one too. It helps to keep the metal at the top from dragging on the drum. You just need training  that’s all. The primary shoe spring is supposed to be installed before the secondary spring. You will notice that the anchor pin is tapered in order to put more tension on the secondary spring.This helps the brakes to engage when driving in forward gears. You may notice that the parking brake works better when the car is facing downhill too. Put them on wrong and the opposite will be true. If you have more questions  read the manual first. It isn’t a consensus  it’s instructions.

Clear evidence of that stark fact has been available to anyone who has removed hundreds of brake drums over the years. Some had the greater shoe forward while others did not.The initial post seems to make good sense  yet you seem educated on the topic as well. One thing is certain: long-held beliefs are often overturned.Perhaps you were instructed in Drivers? Education that placing your hands at the 10/2 ?o clock position was sound thinking. Today that configuration is considered an unworkable concept. (save for NASCAR steering wheels which are low  and removable to allow for exit.) . So  which position is correct for the shoe with the longer friction material? (I suppose we should start with the more basic question: ?Why does one shoe HAVE more material??  and go from there.) Do we contact the engineers at Bendix (almighty) over this  can Click & Clack settle the hash  or what?

Bendix once had a patent on that design. Today  everyone uses it in one form or another. If one shoe has more lining material than the other  that shoe  the “secondary”  is ALWAYS mounted towards the REAR of the vehicle. Period.Here is why. At rest  the shoes are centered by a pin at the TOP. When you step on the brakes  the wheel cylinder pushes BOTH shoes off the pin. The front (leading  primary) shoe is “drawn” into the rotating drum  a wedging effect  BUT it is connected by the bottom self-adjuster link to the rear shoe. Remember  both shoes are trying to rotate with the spinning brake drum…The REAR SHOE is getting force applied from TWO DIRECTIONS  the hydraulic wheel cylinder AND THE BOTTOM LINK. This means the secondary (rear) shoe gets more overall force applied to it than the leading (primary) shoe. The big shoe goes on the back side…Many backyard mechanics make the mistake of installing them backwards  and in another life when I was a State Inspector  I would flunk their cars for 'Incorrectly Installed Brakes". Usually  they will work okay  but they will wear unevenly and sometimes can get grabby as the self-actuation of the too big front shoe nears 100%…

Yet are you failing to see something? As the forward shoe is forced down  the back-shoe is forced upward  against its’ wheel cylinder?s piston  thereby adding more pressure to the net pressure within that cylinder. With that pressure having to go somewhere it must affect the not-immobile forward half of the piston  pushing it forward even more so.Add to this the forward-most section of the brake drum?s inner surface is pressing hardest against the front shoe. There can be no doubt about that  right? I?m confused  which shoe actually IS getting the most overall net force against it? I appreciate that you have been educated on this overall topic  yet who was your teacher? Clearly you are merely repeating / arm-chairing what you?ve been told. I mean you?ve conducted no scientific testing / industrial assay on the system we?re discussing  correct? It does appear at this point gentlemen that we have an open and unresolved issue.

A lot of old Chrysler products that I owned  but didn’t buy new had equal length shoes and a wheel cylinder with one piston at both top and bottom facing in opposite directions so that both shoes were self energizing. This was a superior design but lost out to the cheaper to manufacture Bendix when power brakes were able to overcome the disadvantage of the Bendix design.

And yes  some designs do indeed use two identical shoes… But I have seen to two long ones on one side of the car and the two short ones on the other…

The rear-facing piston in the brake cylinder does not budge. The rear shoe does not add any pressure to the fluid in the brake cylinder.While I would not rule out the possibility that somewhere there are brakes designed upside down relative to the ‘norm’ (that is  they have the slave cylinders at the bottom and the adjuster at the top) every car I have ever worked on  foreign or domestic  needed to have the shoe with the longer friction surface mounted toward the rear of the car.

My auto repair instructor - Mr. Hayden  a drunken Irishman - seemed quite insistant on the point. However  those who can’t do teach? Now  I would like to know: (1) Why does one shoe have less material? (2) If the shoe with less material was designed to be placed forward  what was the engineers’ reasoning for that positioning?

I?m sorry  but I do not see what you write as a likely scenario. If your viewpoint were a part of reality the upper portion of the rear shoe would know virtually no wear  if any  while the lower portion received an amount that would be unacceptable.

When you push the brake pedal  both shoes move out until they contanct the drum. At that point  the friction between the drum and the shoes rotates them both  forcing the rear shoe back to the pin and the rear piston back into the brake cylinder as the front piston pushes the front shoe further out.

Add to this: Bolted together as one cohesive part  are the rear-wheel  brake-drum and axle-shaft. When the brakes are applied it is that cohesive part that brutally grabs at the road - an action that forces this wheel/drum/axle-shaft assembly to violently leap relatively rearward - pressing the inner surface of the brake drum most-so upon the forward-facing shoe.

Now it is time to find the facts. I think it is time for the OP to do the experiment. Measure and record the lining thickness of the short and long shoe. Install the long shoe forward and short shoe rearward (install in the same orientation on each axle side for safety). Drive the vehicle 5K to 10K miles. Remeasure the lining thicknesses.I postulate that the forward placed long lining will have worn significantly less than the rear placed short lining. I am also an adherent to the long shoe going to the rear and the short shoe going to the front. This is contingent on only one anchor being above the wheel cylinder. All of the relinings I have done that way have worked well; had effective braking; and worn evenly in that configuration.IIRC 60ish VW beetle rear brakes had a double wheel cylinder above but there was a solid anchor at the bottom. The shoe linings were the same length. However  the front shoe always wore faster that the rear. On yearly inspection  the front and rear shoes could be exchanged to even out the wear. Just thought I would muddy up the water more.Let us know the results of your experiment.

Another possibility is that the top end of the lining would wear down rapidly. The short lining is usually thicker too. It prevents the top end of the shoe from wearing a groove down the center of the drum. It’s better to keep the metal away from the metal. If the tip scrapes the drum  the lining isn’t making full contact.

The only way to move up the ladder as a “mechanic” was to become fast at rear drums. Believe it or not many people are challenged by rear drum brake shoe replacement  or at least going fast at it. I knew a Chevrolet heavy line mechanic that could replace rear shoes 10 min. a side  but he could not figure out how to unlock the radio after he had the battery disconnected.

So many cars have gone to disc brakes that those needing shoes are few and far between.Don’t the shoes still have “PRIMARY” and “SECONDARY” imprinted on the edge of each shoe? No more arguments  just read the shoe and put the primaries on the front sides.

This is why many manufacturer’s stayed with drums on the rear for so long… when disc systems became a clearly better choice. the drum allows for a simple solution to employ an emergency brake. In fact today often when you find a vehicle with disc brake systems on the rear… you will often find (designed and installed into the bell of the rear rotor)  a minor drum brake architecture. It’s used to employ the emergency brake on an otherwise rear disc brake set up.

It has been a great car from day one. I have only had to do basically maintenance repairs on it like brakes  plugs  oil  tires  control bushings  control arms and so on. The only two  well three issues I have with it is the drivers door will not lock/unlock with the power locks. The hazard lights don’t work. And of course the ac.But last year the ac started blowing only hot air. I put it off until this spring and I took it to get recharged. My mechanic hooked it up and recharged it but it still was blowing hot air. He said that the compressor was bad. So I picked up a used one for $25 off ebay with a 1 year warranty. Got it installed and took it back to my mechanic. Nothing  would not engage. I got a bad one. No big deal. I got my money back and this time I bought a remanufactured one with a 3 year warranty. Got it installed and took it back to my mechanic. Everything looked good but again it would blow hot air. He tested the system by turning the fan on with his scan tool  and it would work fine. But there is no way to keep it on without the scan tool connected. All of the fuses are ok. But with the TIPM  I cannot find a relay for the ac.

Don’t be surprised if the new mechanic wants to replace the compressor again and replace much more of the AC system. It is nearly impossible to clean the debris out of an AC system once a compressor has failed. You compounded the problem by installing a super-cheap used compressor with an unknown history that may have added its own trash to the system. You won’t like his estimate for repair. And your car isn’t worth the amount of his estimate.I’d suggest just drive it with the windows down and be thankful you’ve gotten as many miles out of this car you have.

123476,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2008-impreza-car-barely-starts-no-lights/123476,2008 Impreza Car Barely Starts & No Lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||impreza||lights||subaru||,1,lacrossefreak17,Hi All First time to the forum and am looking for some troubleshooting help on my 2008 Impreza.Start of problem: The problem started a few days ago when I took out the battery to replace my driver side turn signal. Upon putting the battery back in the problem began.Problem: The problem has evolved throughout some troubleshooting. After putting the battery back into my car it would not start. It would fire up for about 1s then die almost instantly. After a few tries I found that if I started the car and gave it just a tap of gas  the car would start and would idle normally. When I finally got the car to start back up a whole bunch of lights lit up the dash (cruise control flickering  tire pressure flickering  check engine on  traction control on  etc.) and checking Torque the voltage on the battery was low (so many sensor problems pointed to battery) so I replaced it with an Interstate battery after getting it tested at an autoparts store. I fired it back up and now the car barely starts now but did fully start 5 times in a row (it fires up and nearly dies over the course of about 5s then proceeds to idle normally).Troubleshooting: I tried unplugging the MAF before swapping the battery which very marginally improved starting capability. MAP sensor I also tested before swapping the battery and made the car start even worse.Current state of the car: I had to drive the car home after replacing the battery and it drove just fine. The car died 3x over the course of about 2 miles but ONLY died when I was coasting in neutral up to stoplights. Engine braking and idling functioned just fine and the car seemed to drive normal. All lights are off in the car.My next steps for troubleshooting would be to unplug the MAF / MAP and try driving to see if it still installs. I will likely drive it to a nearby auto shop to check the alternator. At this point I really have no idea as to what the issue could be. Google searches for hours really led to nothing.Anyone have experience with symptoms like this? What approach should I take and what should I look at first?Side note: About a week before when driving down the road my ABS  traction control and hill assist lights all came on. I did not get the chance to scan for codes as the lights when back off after a few miles. Not sure if this could be related.6

It should measure appx 12.6 volts before the first start of the day  and immediately after starting and idling the engine  in the 13.5-15.5 volt range. Measure at the battery posts  and at the connectors. There should be little to no difference. What does your battery measure? If the voltages are ok  presuming there are no stored diagnostic codes in computer memory  my next guess is the computer has somehow forgot the learned engine operating parameters and must now re-learn them. You may need to go to a dealership for help w/this  but you could try driving the car around the neighborhood at slow speeds and see if it starts to behave better the more you drive it.

Torque shows battery at idle is 13.3-13.5v but heavily favors 13.5. Will have access to voltmeter tomorrow.No stored codes.What makes you think it may have forgotten operating conditions and how would this have happened? I am not familiar with this occuring. Is there a way to test if this is the case or is this simply the last resort?
123476,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2008-impreza-car-barely-starts-no-lights/123476,2008 Impreza Car Barely Starts & No Lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||impreza||lights||subaru||,4,Mustangman, [ how would this have happened? ] The engine control computer is constantly “learning” how your engine operates  what the sensors say  how much time to leave the injector open to fuel each cylinder and many other things as well. It adjusts for variations in components used to build the engine and so as the engine ages the computer maintains the efficiency and emissions. It doesn’t store all these “adjustment” in non-volatile memory so when the battery is removed  the adjustments are reset to zero.BTW  Torque is telling you \the alternator voltage when the car is running - the 13.5 volts - and the battery voltage only when the car is turned off - the 12.6 volts. On the custom screen  add a gauge to measure battery voltage - the gauge choice with a minimum value and maximum value. That allows you to monitor if the voltage is dropping too low to run everything - 10V or so - anytime you drive the car. Or even drops back to battery voltage anytime you are driving. That will tell you if the alternator is failing.That’s what I think may be going on the alternator is failing!

Battery was around 13.95v when on and turning on radio  headlights and both lights in cabin dropped it to 13.89v. Any other test I should be doing to confirm function? It really wont drive well as it stalls fairly often so probably not going to get averages easily!

Indicate both the battery and alternator are ok. There could still be a problem with the battery connection to the rest of the car  either a problem at the posts  cables  or with the ground connection at the chassis. When you say “all lights are off”  are you referring to the dashboard warning lights? The headlights and tail-lights work  right? Those dash warning lights are supposed to be off when you are driving. That means the electronics think the car is working correctly. They should turn on with the key in “on” before you crank the engine  then go out soon after starting the car. I’m presuming that’s the case for you.so what’s wrong ? … hmmmm …two guesses  the first I alrealdy mentioned  disconnecting the battery caused the learned engine parameter to be lost  and they have to be re-learned. The other is that somehow a fuse got blown. The latter seems unlikely if the electrical systems are otherwise behaving ok  and the only problem is stalling when in neutral.I think what I’d do if I had that problem myself – assuming there’s no obvious problem like a vacuum hose has come loose  battery connector loose or frayed or wobbly – is check the idle rpm. First make sure the air cleaner is good  the ignition timing is in spec  and the ignition system & spark plugs are good. Once the engine is warmed up  the idle rpm should be 650 for a manual transmission  and 700 for an automatic (both cases idling in neutral). Next turn on the AC and let the compressor work a full minute. At that point the idle rpm should be 850. Specs for 2.5 L SOHC engine.Edit: Another idea  disconnect the battery and leave it disconnected over the course of one night. Once the battery is reconnected  that can sometimes cause the computer to automatically enter the re-learn mode.

I presume they are related but may not be! I have also read some about the tps sensor or wheel position sensor going bad can cause some similarish symptoms as well.I am currently in the process of moving so i may not get to more troubleshooting until this weekend. I will try unplugging the battery overnight and see what that does for me then go after idle rpm.Results to come. Thank you very much!

As part of their efforts to get a five star safety rating and to meet new federal requirements Toyota has implemented active head restraints in this car. Unfortunately  this also means that the headrests cant forward at a ridiculous angle and cause excruciating neck pain after about fifteen minutes of driving. We took the car into the dealer  and while all the service people agreed that the headrests look like a bad design  they are not allowed to make any modifications under federal law. My solution has been to take the headrests out and turn them around  which reduces the chronic neck pain issue  but of course defeats the purpose of having a head restraint in the first place. Having previously had a neck injury  I would like to avoid the experience again. I’m left with the conundrum of accepting Toyota’s design and a chronic neck injury  or risking an acute neck injury. I’ve thought of trying to build a bending jig to add about 10 degrees of back bend into the head rest posts  but I’m hesitant. I also have tried driving the car with the seats angled way back  but this doesn’t seem to be of much help either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.15

I thought that I might be able to switch the back seat head rests  but the distance between the posts is different. My daughter-in-law has a sienna and she had to remove the rear seat headrests to accomodate the child seats. Suprisingly  these head rests are perfect for me! I checked the wholesale price for them and unfortunately  new ones would be very expensive

Just recline the seat back a bit more than you are doing currently  and the head restraint will be further away from your head and neck.I am not talking about a radical readjustment of the seat back  but rather just a slight increase in the angle of recline. Try it  and you just might be pleasantly surprised at the result.

I had the same problem with my 2010 Cobalt and a HHR I test drove. The salesman (whom I’ve known 22 years) suggested reclining the seat an extra notch or two.My kids bought me a seat cushion with a massage unit  once I installed the cushion my head was about 2" from the head rest. I took the cushion out because I was not comfortable being that far from the head rest.Ed B.

With the headrest turned around  if you have an accident  I bet that your bad neck will suffer an even worse injury.What you should do is get yourself to either a chiropractor or to an orthopedic doctor  and have them inspect your neck and shoulders  look at how you’re sitting in your car  and make suggestions or adjustments to you in order to get you comfortable in your new car.BC.

Something like this would have prevented me from buying such a vehicle since I go on extended test drives before I buy.Any solution you find  other than getting rid of this car  is going to amount to the same thing as turning the head rests around. If you recline the seats or use a cushion  you will be putting distance between your head and the head restraint. You might as well just turn them around and be done with it.

I’ll turn the key and it’ll crank away and do nothing. If I press down the gas while turning the key  I’ll eventually hear a sputter  then another  then another getting faster and faster until the thing finally starts  usually takes 30-45 seconds. Starts fine for the rest of the day.Any clue what causes this or what I can do to make it happen less?I replaced all 8 spark plugs fairly recently. I had a loose battery connection I thought might have something to do with it but I cleaned and tightened it and the problem persists. It also likes to burn oil but that’s less of a problem for me right now.Additional info: I bought the truck secondhand but I’m fairly certain it’s had the engine replaced at some point. Also had an aftermarket exhaust installed.6

A fuel pressure test would confirm. You could also try spraying some starter fluid in the air intake as a test. If it starts and runs briefly  you’ve confirmed the problem is lack of fuel  consistent w/low fuel pressure. If so  probably all you need is a new fuel pump. Good idea to have the fuel filter replaced at the same time.

The type of fluid needed is pretty much always written on the cap. If it is full enough  try pumping the clutch pedal several times and then try to start it. If that works you have air in the clutch hydraulic system somewhere and it needs to be bled and inspected  because it probably has a leak.

As far as I can ascertain 7.8 volts is correct for each cell in the hybrid battery pack. The not exactly clear what you mean “some time delay in engine starting” Do you mean the gas engine is slow to start? Cranks slowly before starting? The gas engine is started by a separate 12 volt battery. That battery may be failing  was it tested?

The problem is that after you have used half a tank of gas  or less  the oil is a quart low. This only happens at high speeds. If you drive around town you can use a whole tank of gas and not use any oil. There doesn’t seem to be any leaks even after the car sits in the same spot for a week or more. Local mechanics have differing ideas. I have not tried adding leak stop to the crankcase. Should I try that? Any other suggestions?19

If so this would be the first thing I would look into. You are putting more load on the engine and therefore more blowby at high speeds. This isn’t exactly a young engine so it MAY just be wearing out but if the PCV cannot vent  it could cause excessive oil consumption. The PCV is cheap though so that would be my first step.There are various snake oil type flushes to clean out the top end and possibly free up sticky rings. You might try some of these if the PCV doesn’t work as you don’t have a lot to lose at this point! Seafoam sucked in through the intake would be my first step.Has the oil ever been neglected in this car?

Try changing your PCV valve.

These are usually cheap and maybe a 5 minute job to swap. I would just buy one at a parts store and change it if the mechanics don’t know.Yes  it is a gamble of maybe $15-20 but that is better than the alternatives. It is cheaper than paying someone to diagnose this as well.I had a car that experienced the same symptoms as yours. It was a 3 cylinder Geo Metro. The engine had been run with a huge gap in the air cleaner assembly by the previous owner for who knows how long… There was enough sand and dirt in the intake that I could scoop it out. Anyway  the car burned oil and LOTS OF IT! We are talking a quart every 100 miles or more! Somehow it still ran great and was getting 52MPG but I swapped the engine once I found a good donor car.

Try the PCV valve first and then the additives if that doesn’t work. You might see if they can free up stuck rings and such. If the 2.4L  you may be out of luck. Just keep an eye on the level and make sure it doesn’t drop too low. You will probably get a lot of life out of it but the inconvenience will get old fast.

It can be used in either or both  say its instructions. I used it for a while  in the gas  to stop preignition knock in my 1984 Cavalier and it seemed to work. Some time later when I had the head into machine shop they commented on how clean (no deposits) it was. I also changed oil within the recommended time/mileage specs.

If I had that problem I’d probably want to do a compression  intake manifold vacuum  and oil pressure test to get some more data to base a decision. I’d also want a valve-stem seal visual test; i.e. does it produce an unusual amount of smoke out the exhaust pipe only during start-up? My guess however is the problem is caused by an accumlated 235K miles of internal engine wear  which only an engine tear-down & rebuild will be able to address.

There is no smoke coming out of the exhaust and it is the 2.4L engine and it is a TC. No testing has been done. My daughter lives 9 hours away from me and I just became aware of the problem.

74540,https://community.cartalk.com/t/car-makes-a-humming-noise-that-gets-louder-at-certain-speeds/74540,Car makes a humming noise that gets louder at certain speeds,Maintenance/Repairs,||honda||civic||,1,gshankara,My 2010 civic started making noise about a couple of months ago. It appears to be coming from the front wheel area driver side. The humming starts off with a lower tone (almost like a small plane flying overhead) and gets louder at certain speeds (35-40mph; 55-65 mph). I have switched to neutral and even turned off the engine momentarily(after ensuring it is safe on a lightly traveled road) to be sure that it is not from the engine.I took it to a Honda dealership and had the service person take a look and he told me that it was the brakes that was causing this. I have a hard time believing him because I do not hear any sounds when I apply the brakes.I had tires replaced since the original tires that were on the car were close to wearing out and was hoping that would fix the problem. But that did not appear to be the problem.I was thinking about the unexpected and that could be the wheel bearings which I would be shocked to see it go bad in a car that has ~40K highway miles.Any thoughts?? Also  would you recommend any good dealerships in the Northern VA area that have good service departments?9

There’s a tab on the pads that rides on top of the rotor to make screechy sound when they have worn down. Brakes are not under warranty and 40K is about right. Usually front brakes go first because that’s where most the weight is but a friend of mine has that same car and I understand that Hondas of that vintage have a propensity of the rear brakes going first because they are undersized. See where the noise is coming from. It travels. If you’re halfway handy and mechanically inclined  you could pop a wheel off and look where the pad is. You’ll notice a piece of spring steel that is now touching the rotor. If you’re daring enough or have done it before  you could replace those brake pads yourself pretty easily  if that’s what’s going on.If the noise doesn’t go away when you tap the brakes  @barkydog advice is the one to consider. Bearings should be under warranty so that shouldn’t cost you anything.Regardless  get it looked at soon.

I meant to say that applying the brakes did not have any effect on the humming noise.

As soon as you said it sounded like a small airplane flying overhead I knew you had the same problem as me. This is how I described the noise to my mom. It also got louder with more speed and softer with less and would start at about 30/40 mph. We took it to a shop and they fix it today. No more noise thank goodness.It was a wheel bearing problem.

He turned off the warning light and told me of a inexpensive way to solve the problem. Run 5 or 6 tanks of premium fuel (91 octane in CO) the start using the mid grade (87 octane)instead of regular (85 octane). I’ve never heard of a fix like this. Is this true? Thanks.8
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,2,bennyandthejets,No. I’ve never heard of that one before  but the endless list of magical fixes for bad cat’s never ceases to amaze me. The octane rating in gas is only a measure of how much of an additive the gas has which makes it more subject or less subject to preignite. (knock) I don’t for the life of me have any idea how the octane rating would be related to fixing a worn out cat. It’s actually frightening to hear how many snake-oil-type salesmen are out there. I think in this case he might not be purposely misleading you  (because he has nothing to gain by you purchasing a more expensive grade of fuel) but perhaps (giving him the benefit of the doubt) was just misinformed and passing on some bad information without realizing it. Sorry. If your cat is bad  you can do a lot of neat little tricks  but the only one that will fix your problem is replacing the bad cat. If you knew how much CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbons - ie: unburned fuel) that the cat converted into cleaner air during its lifetime  you would have sympathy for it and give it a proper burial.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,3,hellokit,IF the engine has been misfiring  because it has been running gasoline which has octane that is too low for it to run smoothly  higher octane could help; but  that’s a big IF. Keeping the engine in tune  and performing the routine scheduled (by miles) maintenance  will prevent a lot of raw fuel from reaching the catalytic converter and overloading it  and the oxygen sensors  with deleterious effects. This  in the end  is the cheaper alternative to changing a lot of expensive parts later.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,4,Caddyman,Octane will not cause mis-fire one way or the other. Nor will using premium fuel restore a tired cat.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,5,the_same_mountainbike,Wow. And did he tell you why this was?Catalytic converters are unaffected by the octane of the gas unless it creates an engine operational problem. And  once something like that affects a converter  which can only happen with contamination of the platinum palladium on the ceramic matrix from perhaps burning oil or by collapse of the ceramic from overheating due to  say  too lean an operating temperature (which would trigger other problems like preignition) changing octanes will not heal it. Even the downstream oxygen sensor that monitors the performance of the converter if damaged by burning oil would not heal from a change in octane.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,6,hellokit,The engine can be affected by octane levels. An engine which has carbon deposits will have a higher compression ratio  which  if high enough  can necessitate a higher octane fuel in order not to misfire and or ping. When an engine misfires  the fuel it did not burn goes to the catalytic converter. Poorly burned fuel will produce soot (carbon) which coats the inner surfaces of the exhaust  the catalytic converter  and the oxygen sensors. An engine which is restored to a better operating condition  can help to clean up the exhaust system. A tune up  and  if needed  higher octane fuel (because of ping and misfire)  could help in this cleanup.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,7,oldschool,I cannot be convinced that a cat with poor efficency can be “revived” by using high octane fuel and I cannot accept that using lower than required octane will cause a missfire  I looked through my tech books and I just can’t make it work.I am willing to keep listening about the missfire idea.
21459,https://community.cartalk.com/t/catalytic-converter/21459,Catalytic converter,Maintenance/Repairs,||z3||bmw||,8,hellokit,Some perfectly healthy engines run worse on higher octane fuel  rather than  better. Try it. It’s a cheap experiment. You can get an idea of what the catalytic converter looks like  and what may be going on in the engine by looking at the oxygen sensors.

It doesn’t rev pointlessly  the acceleration just stops. I can get the engine to rev momentarily and jerk forward but actual acceleration is only possible by completely flooring the gas pedal and “powering through” the issue.I’ve taken it to a mechanic twice  the first time they replaced the Mass Airflow Sensor and told me that there had been too many old codes to get a clear picture of what was happening for certain and to bring it back in a few days to see what new codes had appeared. I bought it back three days later after experiencing the issue again. When they attatched the sensor it brought back no relevant codes  and the only sign of any issue with the car was the battery was .4 volts below the expected output.The mechanic said that the codes told them nothing relevant but even if it probably wouldn’t help they’d be happy to fix the battery issue. I can’t afford to make repairs in the hope that it might possibly help. So I guess what I’m asking is what could be causing this issue and is it likely to kill my car if I don’t get a repair quickly?7

And test that the Throttle position sensor is within range.Has anyone been under the hood just prior to this problem arising? If so  maybe a part was not put back on properly aligned   and this is causing the throttle cable binding.Yosemite

You’d also need bulky gloves. (This was a fun mental exercise  though).While one is right to be thinking about ways to improve things  I feel this is a non-problem. Critical surfaces like journal bearings and piston walls retain sufficient oil beyond the time period of an oil change  likely more oil than on a cold start and cars last for many thousands of those. Modern engines with modern oils rarely suffer from wear problems when maintained as recommended  and this with conventional oils (when allowed)  and without pre-filling filters - cars usually are retired for other reasons. If you want to do the best for your car change oil more frequently if doing many short drives  do other inspections/maintenance at recommended time/mileage schedules  and if the mfgr. didn’t recommend a schedule for a fluid then inspect/test periodically and/or change at sensible intervals.

The screw on filter on my motorcycle is horizontal and pre filling is effective.

An idling engine with the throttle nearly closed has a high vacuum in the intake manifold  which means that on the compression stroke  the pistons are compressing a vacuum going most of the way up the cylinder before the pressure in the cylinders is even at atmospheric pressure. This means there is very little load on the bearings of an idling engine. This is also why four stroke gasoline engines idle so smoothly. A gasoline engine could probably idle for an hour without oil pressure without ruining the bearings. The speed is slow and the load is low and the oil film retained by capillary forces would serve to lubricate the bearings. Diesels never throttle the air so even at idle there is full compression and that’s why diesels shake so much while idling.Yes  closing the throttle effectively lowers the compression of a gasoline engine  that’s why you can drive a car that needs premium to the next gas station on regular if keep the intake manifold vacuum high by limiting the throttle opening. There were some WWI airplane engines that were purposely over compressed for the octane of the fuel available  the idea was to achieve maximum engine efficiency at high altitudes and they could only be run at full throttle at high altitudes  at ground level  they had to be run at reduced throttle to prevent detonation.

If the bolt gets damaged  or sheared off  extracting the remainder may damage the crankshaft. You can see where this is going. I wouldn’t try it just for the sake of seeing if I could. Why take on that unnecessary risk? But if you are going to  be extra careful the socket is fully seated on the head of the bolt first  and doesn’t slip off as you exert force.

You can tie into pulley system as Shadowfax suggested  but instead of having to use a second vehicle  just use the second engine. Fabricating a mount that will hold the engine directly above the OEM engine will likely be the easiest solution so I would recommend doing away with the drivers side front wheel and mounting this secondary engine there. The beauty of this idea is that it solves both issues- when you change the oil in engine #1- use engine #2 to run the oil through engine #1 BUT WAIT! when you change the oil in engine #2  you know have a backup engine to get that oil through the engine- ENGINE #1!!!This really is a perfect idea  and I cannot believe that car manufactures have not thought of this yet…

The dipstick is just above F. ] F does not mean the engine is “full of oil”  it simply means it’s up to the highest recommended oil level. On an idling engine  that extra oil needed to fill the oil filter will do no harm and it will quickly drop to “F” as the engine idles and the oil filter fills up. The oil level doesn’t have to up to the “F” mark  being between the F and add marks is fine. As long as the oil pump’s pickup tube is in the oil to pick it up  the engine doesn’t know the difference. The oil sump is just a tank to hold the engine’s oil supply  the oil pump pumps the oil to the engine to lubricate it. Splash oiling is only used in antique cars and lawn mowers. Some engines even have a separate oil tank where the oil waits to be picked up by the oil pump while a second oil pump picks up the oil in the bottom of the sump and returns it to the oil tank  common on old British motorcycles and radial airplane engines  also on some race cars in order to allow a shallow sump for more ground clearance when the engine is very low to the ground. These are called “dry sump” engines. That photo of a Honda CB 750 crankshaft with the power takeoff from the center of the crank was a dry sump engine.

It’s a 14 year old car  it’s a moving part that wears out. Compressor replacement is a common repair for A/C systems.When you have it repaired be sure the fan clutch on your car is tested and verified as working properly. High head pressures can shorten the life of a compressor.

Will narrow the possibilities down  make the diagnosis easier. A spare spark plug can be used to test for spark when cranking for example. And spraying starter fluid into the intake during attempted cranking can point to a fuel related problem.

The problem hasn’t happened again yet with several stops and starts. It’s intermittent. It’s started immediately each time.When something similar happened a few months ago  it turned out the battery cable had become disconnected or shorted  but I thought they fixed it - and I assume then it didn’t even turn over but don’t remember.

That is the fuel pump. When you turn the key first to run (not start) the computer will turn the pump on to prime the fuel lines for about 20 seconds and then shut off. When you turn the key beyond run to start to activate the starter motor  when the engine starts  the computer will turn the pump back on and will run continuously until you shut the car down. The fuel pump sounds like a humming sound coming from the back of the car. So when you first turn the key to on  listen for any buzzing humming sound coming from the tank. If you don’t hear anything and the car won’t start  the fuel pump is not running. (bad pump  relay  computer  wiring  etc.) The other way is to hook up a fuel pressure gauge. But yeah  fuel or spark  which one?

I tried dozens of times to start it (I didn’t hear any buzz for 20 seconds if I just turned the key on).After 40 minutes I tried a few more times. It wouldn’t start.

And of course  I’d be buying it as a project  with the understanding that it’s going to take a lot of work to become a useful vehicle.I would value the car on the assumption that at a minimum  I’m going to have to replace the cylinder head(s)  head gasket(s) and bolts  all coolant hoses  all belts  water pump  thermostat  radiator  and radiator cap. Of course  there are a lot of incidental parts which would need to be replaced as well  but you get the idea. I would buy everything from Rockauto  except for the used head(s)  I’d get from a you-pull-it junkyard and have them checked and reconditioned by a professional machine shop.If this sounds like something you are willing to do  and the seller is pricing the car appropriately  then by all means go for it. If on the other hand  the seller is charging close to the value of a properly running car  and trying to say it has some minor problem  such as “just needs a new radiator” or “just needs a new thermostat” then RUN  don’t walk away from this “deal”.

Bubbles indicated no leaks when removed & laying flat on the ground. Only leaked when installed on the truck. I figured it out by painting soap bubbles to the rim area when it was mounted on the truck. I had to do that experiment several times  each time after parking the truck in a different tire orientation. I eventually saw where the leak was coming from  at the rim/tire interface. I removed the tire from the rim  cleaned & wire brushed the rim’s bead surface  and re-installed the tire using bead sealer. No leaks since.

When the tire is mounted on the truck  the weight of the truck is forcing the sir in the tire out of the cracks in the sidewall of the tire. ] An unmounted tire at 39 psi is at the same pressure as a mounted tire at 39 psi (probably with less air in it when mounted.) To the extent that pressure is what matters the cases are the same. Bearing the weight of the truck causes the part on the street to splay  which would exacerbate the leakiness of cracks there.

I don’t think that you will get much air pressure increase by putting the tire on  however you will get sidewall and tread flex while rolling that you would not get sitting in your truck bed. That being said a small nail or whatever can leak under the same circumstances. I had a tire with a slow leak I could not find for at least a couple months. The leaking progressed to a faster rate and I eventually found a small nail. Removed it  plugged tire  and no more issues.

I think I’ve come to the end of the efforts I want to put into finding the leak. Mr @George_San_Jose1 gave the only useful response but I’m not going to unmount the tire and do that. I anticipate buying new tires eventually. I have to drive it in March to get the emissions test; I may put a new floor in the bathroom first.

I don’t think I will change. [ I suspicion like others are saying  it may just be old tires and leaking through the cracks. ] Me too. I asked here for other ideas. [ I don’t think that you will get much air pressure increase by putting the tire on  ] Why not? I’d be apply about 1 000 pounds of force on it. Imagine I had a sealed air piston and rested my axle on it instead: it’d show the pressure. [ a small nail or whatever can leak under the same circumstances. ] I’ve found small nails in my tires before.

Reduce the tire pressure to 25 PSI and puddle water on the bead/rim area  watch for bubbles.

Reducing pressure to look again is a good idea.I remember the real reason I asked the question: what should I do when I buy new tires to get the installer to inspect that rim particularly? If I pay just the fee for mounting and balancing  s/he won’t even look  right? Is that guy/gal just a flunky whom I can’t trust to inspect the rim properly? Would it be simpler to get a new tire then wait for a leak to show?

[ Or is it just the time she waits for AAA to respond? ] AAA actually hasn’t been involved (yet).Tester: [ Or  does this only occur when the engine is hot? ] It’s only happened when the engine is hot … so I guess temperature is another variable.

Add apps for AAA (if you are a member)  and various hotels as well as a rental car company that picks you up  like Enterprise.A full size spare is nice but eats up a TON of room in the trunk. If that’s OK with you  go ahead. I’d leave it behind. Same with hoses and belts. A 300C is not exactly exotic anywhere in the US or Canada and the roads are not exactly “arduous” anymore. Heck the AlCan highway is completely paved now. Detroit city streets are rougher than the AlCan.Do all the maintenance you normally do and a few that tend to get ignored like brake fluid flush  transmission fluid and filter change  cabin air filter change  and differential fluid and power steering fluid. All that is past due at 95K if you haven’t done it.Ignore the transmission fluid cooler unless you plan to tow a trailer  the car doesn’t need it.If any issues arise on the trip  use the phone to summon help  get a tow and find a hotel near the auto shop that will be repairing your car. Rent one if the repair is longer than you’d like to stay and pick it up on the way home.Enjoy your trip!

No matter what you prepare for or what spare parts you take  if you encounter a problem  it will be for something you never planned (see Laws of Murphy).Agree that if you keep up with “needed stuff” then there’s no problem hopping in for an extended road trip. I keep up with “needed stuff” on the old Grand Prix  pack up  and drive 1500 miles in a little over a day. It runs like it does when I go to the store or to play golf  no problem… Purrs like a kitten. CSA

You don’t need a transmission oil cooler  unless are tow a trailer. AAA membership is recognized by the CAA in Canada and they have service everywhere. US insurance is good in Canada as well.This car will stand up fine and give you a comfortable holiday.Service for the 300C is available all over Canada  but a spare belt might make sense.Have a nice trip.

Since parts should be readily available on the road wherever you are  bring enough money so you can buy them when needed is probably the best advice I can offer. I might be tempted to replace the thermostat and do a pressure test on the cooling system myself  but that’s about it.Common sense says at the minimum to bring all the routine maintenance up to date  check the tires and brakes to spec  and test the battery and charging system before you go. Best of luck.

Not saying that there are other reasons but the majority are tire related. Make sure you have good tires  that is quality tires in good condition. Take a compact 12V air compressor and a good tire gauge. Check and balance your tire pressures early in the morning a few days before you start the trip and go about 2-3 psi higher than the pressure listed on the placard. While on the trip  visually check your tires each day but don’t use the gauge unless a tire looks low or the TPMS light is on.Take a cell phone and charger as recommended. If each of you have a cell phone  it is best if you are on plans with different companies  better chance of coverage although any company that hears a 911 call is obligated to pick it up even if you are not one of their customers.If you stray off the beaten path  you should have 2 gallons of distilled water per person. The distilled water can double for the radiator if needed. This is in addition to the regular drinking water you plan on carrying. I always take a case of drinking water in the 700 ml sports bottles that i get from Costco. Also take a warm sleeping bag for each person just in case. I also take some food like fig bars and some juices for snacking. All of these can save your life if stranded  but are just convenient to have along if you find yourself hungry and a long way from the next town.Lastly  take a GPS along  even a cheap Garman that you can get from Cabellas or Bass Pro for about $110. It doesn’t come with the built in maps so also get a good Atlas for the areas you will be traveling in. Look for an atlas with the GPS lines on the maps so you can locate yourself on hte map with the GPS unit. And take enough batteries  oh and a flashlight  a whistle and a mirror.

Is it really necessary  and can I do it myself easily and cheaper?35
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,2,texases,Yes and yes. I bought several filters from Rock Auto for a fraction of the dealer cost. See if the instructions on replacement are in your owners manual  or find an Elantra forum and ask there. It’s usually pretty easy.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,3,VDCdriver,On most late-model cars  replacing the cabin air filter involves merely removing the glove box (which is far easier than it sounds  and requires no tools)  and then flipping open or removing a small plastic cover over the filter.I would be very surprised if the Hyundai Owner’s Manual didn’t include the instructions  but in case the instructions are missing from the manual  a Hyundai-specific internet forum will allow you to get the directions from other owners who have already done this simple task.And  the filter can most likely be found at a local auto parts store for…maybe…$15. That outlay of cash + a few minutes of the OP’s time will yield the desired results.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,4,cigroller,$100 to replace the cabin air filter is one of those things that give dealer service departments a bad name. So yes and yes. Personally  I would remove the filter and inspect it before even buying a new one. As @VDCdriver noted  it should be as east as this:

Thanks so much! I had a feeling the guy was just trying to increase his commission. He also said you need to balance the tires when they are rotated. I’ve never heard of that before.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,6,cigroller,If the tires were properly balanced when installed then you never need to balance them again - unless you start to get symptoms that suggest something has changed - the symptoms would involve vibration/shimmy  often at higher speeds. However  suggesting a check of balance while rotating is not an unusual thing for a shop to do. IMHO it’s less out of line than asking $100 to change a cabin air filter.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,7,texases,While $100 is steep  it’s pretty typical of what dealers ask…

The Toyota dealer here charges about $35 which is still too much but with three independents and 4 auto parts stores less then half a mile away  he has little choice on items that everyone knows are cheap but to be competitive. That doesn’t seem to be the case where you are. I always wondered why this being the only new car dealer in this local town  surrounded by independents and auto parts stores is fairly reasonable in a lot of it’s services  till started counting.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,13,cigroller,I think $35 is ok. The place has to make some money. But $100 - I don’t care if it’s “typical” - it’s what gives dealer service depts a bad name. That  and telling someone they have to balance whenever they rotate. It all harkens back to this other thread about “selling”…
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,14,dagosa,$35 is ok but just ok when there are several places nearby that will sell mine for under $25. They are hoping that the extra $10 won’t seem too bad  especially considering most people don’t open their manual in the glove compartment and realize they have done much of their cabin filter installation work already just opening the glove box to get the manual out. Scary isn’t it ?Besides  it’s much easier to live with a cheap cabin filter then a cheaper engine air or oil filter as most of we car guys value our motors more then we do our lungs…another scary thought !
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,15,cigroller,Well  I figure $25 for the $10 filter  and $10 to install it. 10 minutes (generously)  so that’s actually a relatively cheap $60/hr labor rate. It sounds to me like $100 is $50 for a $10 filter and $50 for the 10 mins to install  so about $300/hr.
84051,https://community.cartalk.com/t/hyundai-climate-control-air-filter/84051,Hyundai Climate Control Air Filter,Maintenance/Repairs,||elantra||suspension||hyundai||,16,dagosa,10 minutes to install it ? Does that include the complementary wash job that our dealership gives…to go along with the complementary (…) job on their customers ? Plus  just this past year they have failed to use a new transmission plug gasket causing a leak  and lost one of my hub caps ( by putting it on too loose). I did rip them until they gave me another…but they still owe ME.I got a sense of distrust so I went to my alternate a “Trusted Independent.” he charged me more for an oil charge and forgot to put the oil filler cap back on. Honest stuff. Lucky  the noise made me look under the hood and I found it on the intake manifold  10 miles away. Everyone skews you.Now  I caught all the mistakes but look at the guy who would have lost his transmission in one place and damaged his motor in another.

And every time I had to get something done I had to spend all this money - just to go back spend more time and money to fix things that someone else screwed up. Now I just screw it up my darned self.

It saddens me to think of how many people routinely get screwed at some dealerships.Some year back  when my car was newer  my sliding roof started to whistle  to not close tightly. It was past the warranty. I went to the dealer service manager (NOT the service consultant) seeking a solution. He told me  and I quote  “we’ve seen this on these cars… it’s because you’re using it (the sliding roof) too much. We’ll have to replace the entire unit for $4 000”. Smelling a BS artist  I said “say what?” thinking I must have heard him incorrectly. He repeated his BS. I shook my head  drove away  and did some research. Turns out  Toyota had an “initialization procedure” to reset the roof’s program in the BCU. It required opening the roof fully  closing the roof completely  and pushing the button again and holding it for 90 seconds. It’s supposed to be done as part of each vehicle’s delivery prep. 180 seconds later and a few button pushes  my roof was fixed. I’ve never returned to that dealership and never will. But I wonder how many people got screwed.Sincere best.

Part prices on-line or from a local parts house cannot be compared to a dealer part and there’s more time involved than what is shown in that video.There’s service writer time  dispatcher time (if applicable)  parts counter time  and mechanic time from flagging in on the job  finding the car in the lot  running it in  standing at the parts counter for hopefully not very long  doing the job  running the car out  and flagging off of the job.The fact that a comparatively simple job appears to be expensive does not mean a scam. What one should do is actually go to work for a dealer on the flat rate pay system. A few years of that may become enlightening when one eye is on the clock all of the time.

I’ve got a great independent shop that has been in business over 20 years. I have heard some people complain that this shop charges higher prices than some other independents. However  the work they have done for me has always been top notch. We depend on them and I would rather pay a higher price so that they make a reasonable profit than to see them go out of business. I’ve seen too many independent shops go under because they didn’t charge enough. Some years back I was putting a new water pump on my car and was turning the air blue trying to get some stuck bolts out. A long time friend who lived around the corner and was in elementary school with me came over and said  “Why are you doing that? You obviously don’t like doing it. Give the work to someone who needs it and likes doing it. Use my rule. I look at a job and if it is going to take me more than half an hour  I hire someone to do it”. I took his advice. I used to do much of my own work because of financial necessity. Now I am in a position and unfortunately the age to gladly pay someone to do the work.

He has been quick to correct it for free. He realizes that I only bring him the hard stuff and do everything easy myself but I have introduced all my relatives and a lot of people in our church to him. The point is  it took me a long time to find him and I have had to deal with a lot of dishonesty  deception and incompetence along the way. I have had 4 good mechanics in my lifetime but 2 retired and one died. If you have a good mechanic  spend as much time praising him as you did complaining about the bad ones.

It’s not worth $100.My favorite is on my Acura. They put a plastic shield between the glove box and the cabin filter drawer for the sole purpose of having to remove the shield  which requires removing the glove box and its frame  when you change the filter so that it’s not an easy DIY job anymore and people will take it to the dealership.I dremeled a hole in the plastic shield and now swap the filter out in 45 seconds

But without a doubt  two people with the same abilities  one working on his own car and one working on someone else time while punching a time clock will have their work separated by their personal integrity and their knowledge that any screw up will be payed for out of their own pocket. It will also be under influence and the direction of the business itself. Individuals do screw up all the time at a rate much much greater then the perfessional mechanic of course.But  remember one thing which you failed to read that my quote was directed to  Cig doing work on his own car within his level of competence. He WILL be more conciencious  like most who post here  including you when working on your own car without your own time constraints. When you  specifically  are payed by the hour  the shop is payed by the job  there is more constraint on you as a professional then you as the same mechanic working at home. You can at home  check that torque for the umpteenth time. Unfortunately  many really fine mechanics are sometimes stymied by the business they work. No reflection on them. Let me add that some are enhanced by sound business practices and do BETTER work then they would on thier own through guidance and the integrity of the shop itself. But it’s the nature of the beast. I see it all the time at the dealership and at the independent I take my cars to  because I know some of these guys personally. A master transmission mechanic  failing to replace the transmission plug correctly ? Definitely not his decision and definitely some other factor related to the professional world he was forced to work in. Factors including the number of vehicles he has to put through and the time he has. Professionalism whether it be in auto mechanics  or teaching like the field I was in  does not automatically make an individual more competent then an non professional with the same attitude working within his own constraints. . Please take that comment in context of everything else I have said.Now  if you are going to be offended by a remark directed at a specific individual in what I feel is his level of competence compared to the professional  that’s for you to re read my other comments. This was cig( and you) not “anyone”. Saying I feel Cig can do a more consistent job is not saying ANYONE else is bad. That is a mistaken assumption on your part. It implys I respect Cigs abilities that much to make fewer mistakes.

Either the water was too deep  you were going too fast or your tires were too worn down to clear the water. Seems like all these 3 were on you.Once you started to slide  the swaybar may have come into play IF you tried to turn the car for some reason. Turning is a poor choice to make when the car is hydroplaning and the only time the swaybar comes into play. Chalk up one more responsibility to the driver. Maybe the crash would not have happened WITH the swaybar  impossible to say since you didn’t describe the accident.Why was the swaybar removed rather than to just replace the bushings? Who approved that? You? Add one more to the responsibility list for whoever chose not to pay to fix the car properly.Am I being a little harsh? Maybe  but personal responsibility goes a long way with me and this smells like an attempt to sue someone not as responsible for this accident as the driver.

I didn’t turn on the engine after changing it  but the car was running just fine immediately beforehand. A point (potentially) worth noting: while changing the air filter  I did clean out the inside of the air filter container with a wet cloth  as my car manual suggested. This morning my car started and then died after 5-10 seconds. The engine “sighed” to a stop rather than abruptly dying. Every time I now start the car  this happens. I’ve checked for loose hoses or wires around the air filter  just in case I knocked something awry  but I didn’t find anything amiss at first glance. Did I cause this  or is the timing a coincidence? Any suggestions for what may be wrong and if I can fix it myself  or do I need to send it to the shop? Thanks for your insight!10

The truck would roll forward in gear only at the idle speed with zero gas pedal input. Pop the hood and…I didn’t put back the fresh air intake duct to the air filter ! The air flow sensor is on that duct  before the air filter  so the result was that the computer could not sense any more air flow than idle. Put the duct back on   slapped myself in the forehead  hoped no one was watching  and away I went. The lesson here  re-check all the hook-ups even if you didn’t knowingly disconnect something  It might be off now.

I agree that you may have knocked off a connector or hose; it is always good to go back and recheck the work that you did.

Right after a cold start the engine runs OK with no apparent problems or roughness. Once warmed up  the car idles really rough in gear (Drive)  RPM really starts to fluctuate between 500 and 700  the car kinda shakes  and the engine is likely to stall if I leave it in gear (and with car not moving) for much longer. If I immediately shift to Neutral at this point (bacially I have to shift to neutral every time the car is stopped) the car would not stall but RPM would surge briefly to 2000+ before going back to normal (900 ish). The problem started suddenly one day after a long (3+ h) drive. Prior to that the car ran smooth. I’ve replaced spark plugs  plug wires  EGR  PCV  IACV  exhaust pipe  catalytic converter  and cleaned the throttle body  without resolving the issue. My code reader sometimes reads a ‘cylinder 4 misfire’ code. What could be the problem?Right now Im guessing maybe a bad O2 sensor or sensor connection  a vacuum leak  or just really worn-out leaky engine cylinders (less likely). What else can it be? Suggestions appreciated9

The engine shake and stall Im experiencing while idling in Drive feels very much like how a stick shift car would shake and stall if you slow down too much without depressing the clutch. But my problem only happens when car is warmed up. Could there be a transmission problem that causes hydraulic clutch binding or something only when the fluid is warmed up?

I’ve done hobby body work since I was 13 and wouldn’t take this on. The good news is that if you have insurance they will total it and pay you off. If you don’t have insurance  that means the car is paid for anyway so time to start over. If you have a loan on the car and didn’t carry insurance  the good news is that the bank put insurance on it anyway but the rates are pretty high.Last year a lady backed into my front end in the drive through lane. So this was a low speed crash. She punctured my bumper cover  broke the headlight  dented the hood and fender a little. By the time all was said and done  the damage was $3000. That’s one reason insurance costs have been going up-hers especially.

My question is pretty simple yet it may be hard to answer. Is it cheaper or better to buy a new vehicle than keep an old one on the road? I love my Land Rover LR3! I bought it new in 2005. I added all the accessories I had ever wanted  she looks unique. My LR has carried me through hurricane flood water  through snow storms  into and out of unpaved areas  across beaches. She is classy  wash her off  head to the valet to be parked up front at a fancy restaurant. She is a class act however she has over 160K miles on the clock. I have retired her to weekend duty. I really want to keep my precious gem but I fear the mounting repair bills. The replacement is well over $60K so new LR is not an option (and the new ones lack appeal). Should I keep her? Forerunner is my pick for a new SUV  yet they lack uniqueness.4

A luxury car like a Land Rover  though with far more expensive cost for repairs and parts? Keeping the old one running may not be cheaper. If you can afford it  keep it going. You clearly love this car  you know the maintenance history  and you don’t seem to be wild about the new things available anyway

I have done great research on this problem  and although there seems to be many many folks with Stabilitrak/Traction Control message issues  none seem to be having the same problem I am having.Problem: After driving my car about 10 minutes  the brake pedal gets progressively stiffer and the car itself is “heavier” (no other way to describe it). If I continue driving  the car will begin to make a low roaring sound  which will get louder and louder if I continue driving. The car also at this point will lose acceleration and it is very difficult to make the car accelerate (that also makes the noise louder). A couple of times (luckily I was in my garage at home after driving)  the car was stopped and when I tried to reverse  the car would not move at all.When this problem first started (about 6 months ago)  the Service Stabilitrak and Service Traction Control messages would come on  but I had a part replaced and that stopped (although the car was still having the same problem) until yesterday when those messages came on again. It has been four months since the messages stopped  yet the car was still having this problem during that time.My remedy to this problem has been to pump the brakes each time I stop (I now take the highway instead of the interstate so that I can make enough stops to do this). I can go about 10 minutes before I have to stop  pump the brakes  and continue driving. This makes the stiffness in the brakes stop and keeps the car from making the noise and having the acceleration problems. The car runs fine as long as I do this.During this six months  I have been to two different auto mechanics AND the local GMC dealer (at least four times). The parts that have been replaced are: right rear hub bearing assembly  EGR valve  rotors resurfaced  left rear caliper repaired  brake pressure modulator valve  and electronic brake control module. The dealership says they do not know what is causing this problem  and they claim they contacted the technicians at GM and they have never heard of this problem. Can I really be the only person in the entire world that has had this problem?I feel this is a problem in the braking system. Something is getting hot the longer I drive and causing something to lock up the wheels  but not enough to stop the car entirely unless I continue driving. What stumps me is why does pumping the brakes help  and why are no service messages or warning lights coming on?Any input or advice will be GREATLY appreciated! Thank you in advance!10

I had a GM pickup that did this and picked it up at an auction for very little money. It did the same thing and locked up several times on the way home. The owner said it would. I changed the rubber brake lines and it never happened again. It’s worth a shot.

The car will still have standard brakes. If THIS resolves the problem  you know the problem is in the ABS system…“Tampering” with the brake system opens a whole new can of worms and I don’t recommend you do this…I’m just saying it’s possible to do it…

The scan tool is then used to calibrate electronic brake control module. The vehicle is then test driven. If the steering goes out of calibration the steering position/torque sensor is replaced.Tester
84363,https://community.cartalk.com/t/in-need-of-a-pontiac-brake-specialist/84363,In need of a Pontiac brake specialist!,Maintenance/Repairs,||torrent||pontiac||,6,the_same_mountainbike,My wild a** guess: the brake booster.The booster uses vacuum from the engine’s intake to pull a diaphragm forward to assist you in applying the brakes. Vacuum is on the front of the diaphragm and the aft surface is vented to atmosphere. When you let the pedal up  the center shaft should open & close valves to enable the chamber aft of the diaphragm to no longer be vented and the pressures in the chambers fore and aft to equalize.If the center shaft isn’t operating properly  which could be due to a misadjusted brake pedal/master cylinder rod  vacuum will slowly pull on the forward portion of the booster diaphragm  constantly applying light braking. As the pads heat up and the fluid transfers it throughout the system  the system slowly tightens up.Abs doesn’t cause brakes to drag. It can only prevent them from being applied. It works by introducing solenoid operated valves into each of the lines. If the computer gets a signal from one of the wheel speed sensors that the wheel isn’t turning appropriately  it sends a squarewave to the associated solenoid  interfering in the brake’s application in a pulsating manner as the squarewave rapidly activates/deactivates the solenoid.Traction control does  however  use brake application to divert energy to another wheel when needed. You should be able to remove the fuse to disable the traction control system as a test.I’m going with a bad brake booster as my first guess. Try disconnecting and clamping (to prevent creating a vacuum leak for the engine) the vacuum line at the booster. Your brakes will be hard and require more force  so don’t take any highway trips this way  but it should tell you whether or not the booster is at fault.

That would also account for the noises and the drag as well as the pumping helping the problem.

It feels like the rotors are badly warped  but the rotors are good  brakes also. They were replaced about a year ago.The car stops just fine - but the way it shudders is terrifying. The whole car shakes.The brakes were bled a few weeks ago  and I was told the rear drivers side had “way too much air in the line.” Bleeding the brakes only slightly lessoned the shuddering. The brakes were bled 2 more times  as air was again in the lines. No doubt they need to be bled again  but what’s the point until I resolve the issue?The problem began a couple months ago  and has become gradually worse. I am getting different answers from different “experts”I can’t afford to put money into a misdiagnosed repair so I’m hoping to find some direction here.The wheel bearings  etc (front end) were replaced about two years ago.I am not burning through brake fluid  only needed to add some after brakes were bled.When car is cold it seems to be worse. A tad less d- d- d -d when braking after car has been driven and has warmed up.Car has a lot of miles on it. 280+Any ideas?Thanks much  Jill14
124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,2,Yosemite,There should not be any air getting into the brake lines  unless there is a bad line allowing air to be introduce it. Sometimes a small rotted line can allow air to be introduced when you let your foot off the brake.Somewhere there is a leak!!!As for the shudder  it could still be the rotors if one got overheated. At times a flexible brake line can act as a check valve and keep a caliper from retracting…then that causes the rotor to warp.I would send this car to a good alignment shop. The alignment tech will find your problem with the shuddering. Your mechanic is missing the problem  because even warped rotors should not Make the entire car shake that bad. I think you have suspension problems and brake problems.It;s not safe for you  other drivers  your passengers  and even pedestrians. Get it checked out!!!Yosemite
124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,3,MikeInNH,How many brake pistons are there?The reason I ask…is because my 05 4runner (and all of that generation) had brake shuddering problems due to one of the 4 pistons on the brake caliper sticking that caused uneven braking. This is a known issue with this generation 4runner. I thought 2001 didn’t have this issue…but maybe it did.I had to replace the front calipers every 50k miles. After my second set I went to NAPA and bought a their calipers with a lifetime warranty. I used that warranty at least 4 times while I owned it.

124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,6,GorehamJ,Here’s my guess having had many Toyotas and a Highlander that eats brakes. Your caliper froze. It then warped the rotor or this happened on multiple corners. Replacement a year ago? In my experience with old Toyota’s that means due for brakes. Hope it is a simple fix and I’m mistaken. Let us know.
124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,7,COROLLAGUY1,Yes  and they start to squeak a lot when one of the caliper is seizing.

But he also tried to tell me my tie rods were the problem.I have been driving this car for 10 years and have never had any problems with my brakes before.Caliper thing is a possibility. I have no idea how many… pistons? Didn’t know they have pistons.I’ll start there  then replace brakes and rotors  then I’ll try to find a leak in the year old brake lines.

One other  you may have an ABS problem. When the brakes were bled did they follow the ABS bleed procedure too? If I had that problem myself  I’d probably just replace the two front calipers  pads  and rotors with new ones. Replace the brake fluid with fresh  new rubber brake hoses  and a proper system bleed. There’s a good chance that will fix it  although you may never know the exact cause.
124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,13,YesDeary,ABS procedure? Ugh! Probably notI’m glad I came here. Not sounding like I need a master cylinoid  which is another answer I was told.Thanks all! Jill
124957,https://community.cartalk.com/t/severe-brake-shudder/124957,Severe brake shudder,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,14,George_San_Jose1,From what I see brake-bleeding on this vehicle requires the use of the Toyota scan tool ( Techstream). That tool is used to turn the ABS selenoids on and off during the process  to make sure the ABS unit is air-free. If that wasn’t done  as part of the next work  have the bleeding done again following Toyota’s procedure.This doesn’t sound like a master cylinder problem to me.

PS fluid leaks often are due to leaky hoses or hose connections.re: $60 to have the parts removed from a junked car. Seems like a fair price to me. Since you can see the junked car you can make an assessment to some degree what kind of shape it is in. If it got hit from the back for example  and is in excellent shape otherwise  and it has less than 100k miles  good chance the parts remain serviceable  so better to pay the $60 b/c you know what car the parts are coming from. That said  I’d probably use re-manufactured parts for that if I had the problem.

I got the reman R&P for our 2006 Mazda 6 from Oreilly for $209 + $40 for the core  but they will give those $40 back to you if you give them your old part. I found a mechanic who was willing to do the job for $150. No problems whatsoeverWhy are you replacing the pump?

124876,https://community.cartalk.com/t/pick-and-pull-prices/124876,Pick and pull prices,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda6||mazda||,19,Nevada_545,The labor guide shows 3.8 hours to replace the rack and pinion assembly  expect to pay about $400 for the labor. If you can find a shop that will install a used junk yard unit they would likely also agree to install a discount parts store remanufactured unit that you provide.
124876,https://community.cartalk.com/t/pick-and-pull-prices/124876,Pick and pull prices,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda6||mazda||,20,Bing,Not to butt in but a rack at Rockauto is $150-320 plus $50 to 100 core charge that you get back. Shipping of course I suppose but I’ve never done that with them. The pump is another $100 to 150 plus the core. But I also can’t see why both would need to be replaced. You have to flush the system so maybe they thought it would be easier just replacing everything instead. I just think you need to know for sure where the leak is. Seals  hose  pump  where? It can’t be leaking from both I wouldn’t think.

I don’t have tools or a workspace ] You want to buy used parts of unknown condition that could result in multiple labor charges without really knowing what is leaking. You could actually spend 2 or 3 times that amount that a shop would cost to repair this with remanufactured parts that would have a decent warranty time. I even wonder how you plan to take these dirty and nasty parts from the junk yard to whoever you chose to do the work . As someone else said you could do this and in a few weeks find yourself right back where you started.
124876,https://community.cartalk.com/t/pick-and-pull-prices/124876,Pick and pull prices,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda6||mazda||,24,Triathlor,Oh sorry I didn’t see your previous reply about the pump  that’s why I asked again.So we have the same vehicle. The reman MasterPro R&P they sell at Oreilly’s is $200+. Orders above $35 is free shipping  or you can pick it up in the store.You can get a R&P cheaper at Rockauto.com but I just like how easy the returns are if I go to a local Oreillys’  plus they offer a lifetime warranty on the parts they sell. I just drive to any local Oreilly’s and that’s it. Money back. I have done it plenty of times. If you get a junk yard part however…I replaced my steering rack around May this year. No problems at all. No leaks whatsoever. Once I got the R&P  it was just a matter of finding a shop that could replace it for me for a good price.If you are trying to save money  the best would be to find out where the leak is coming from. You can use a cheap UV Dye kit. This is how I confirmed it was 100% just the steering rack that was bad.Does your vehicle make any whining  groaning noises while turning the wheel?Again  like everyone else I strongly suggest you to go with a remanufactured R&P. There is a chance you will end up doing this job again.
124876,https://community.cartalk.com/t/pick-and-pull-prices/124876,Pick and pull prices,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda6||mazda||,25,Rockzax,No noise it’s just stiff to turn. When I put the car in reverse I can sometimes hear a noise as if something is rubbing against the rack but it goes away once I put it in drive

The window is quite heavy and could do a lot of damage to your hands and arms.

Here’s an update:The suction cup has arrived  and I’m using it to safety the window (picture #1). Thankfully  @Tester   the nuts/bolts for the regulator line up with the holes when the window is fully elevated in this car. So I’ve had no trouble removing all the nuts from the regulator/motor bolts.However  I’m having trouble getting enough separation at the top of the window to actually remove the window from the regulator. You can see the bolt stick through on picture #2 (and picture #3  close-up–the lower bolt in both pictures). Any suggestions for this anybody?@GeorgeSanJose   no  I don’t have a wiring diagram. If the regulator seems to work well  I’m going to presume that it’s the motor  although I’ll also test the motor with a test light once it’s removed.@BillRussell   no  I didn’t pay the mechanic. His shop is very reasonable  and he agreed to do a quick diagnosis for free…may have had something to do with the fact that I was there with multiple/questions issues (i.e.  future business)  and the fact that the power window was a potential (but unlikely) insurance claim for a minor hit-and-run. Of course  he wasn’t too interested in telling me how I might do it myself  nor of clarifying whether or not the regulator was still good–since  as I said  he could only order the combined unit from his source. I went away to think about this  and other issues.Thanks for the rest of the feedback. If/when I get the unit out  if the regulator seems to be working well–how do I test this??–then I’ll save myself some cash by just ordering a replacement motor.Finally  incidentally  after removing the door panel I found two loose parts (one swimming in the door well): Picture #4. Any idea what either of these are for?Thanks!

Tap on the motor with a small hammer while holding the window switch in the down position. You should lower the window about 4" to align the three lift plate nuts with the three holes in the door. In this position there should be enough room to remove the glass. Without any frame around the glass it will be unstable in the raised position  you should remove it from the door.

Just doesn’t sound like a bad regulator unit. But it’s probably cheaper insurance to replace the motor/regulator for future use.

Strangely  perhaps  the three nuts/bolts on the glass lift plate are aligned when the class is in the (current) fully-up position. (They’re the three holes visible in the centre of the first picture.) It makes sense that lower the window would provide more space in the door to slide the glass off the bolts  but I’d have to lower the window all the way down to the large working space in this case  I think. (Does that makes sense?)If I am able to lower the window by flipping the switch and gently hammering the motor  how will I raise the window again? (I haven’t ordered parts yet  since I’m still trying to determine if the motor & regulator are both shot  or whether it’s just the motor. Some folks are suggesting the switch  but my test light seems to suggest that the switch is okay…)Your feedback is appreciated!

I did this on my car. I think if the window lowers by tapping it with a hammer then you are looking at a bad motor. Just imho

REMOVE DOOR GLASS HINT: Insert a shop rag inside the door panel to prevent scratching the glass. (a) Open the door glass until the nuts appear in the service hole. (b) Remove the 3 nuts and door glass. NOTICE: Do not damage the door glass. HINT: Pull the glass upward to remove it. 15. REMOVE WINDOW REGULATOR ASSEMBLY (a) Remove the 7 nuts and window regulator assembly. HINT: Remove the window regulator assembly through the service hole. (b) Disconnect the connector.If you cut the regulator cable you will be replacing both the regulator and motor.

The window will go up when you push it up  but will fall down unless you tape it in place. If you do this  you will probably have to tape it to the door to keep it up until you fix the regulator issue. I’ve done this  but only when the failed regulator did not hold the window up.

I’ve reattached a close-up showing this. I can get the nuts off easily enough  but I can’t find enough space in the door to bring the glass forward (towards me) to get the bolts off the regulator (pictures #2 and 3 above).Also  without being able to remove the regulator  I can’t access the motor to tap it using a hammer. (It’s mounted to the rear of the speaker  in picture #1 above).Does this make sense? I hope I’m not missing what you’re trying to explain to me!

The service manual for this car states the the window can be removed when the three nuts are aligned with the service holes. You may have to remove the outer belt line molding for additional clearance.I would just tap on the motor with a hammer and lower the window. If you don’t have a small hammer that will fit inside the door use a screw driver to strike the motor.

I asked the dealer to fix it up but they could not find the problem after charging me for 4 hours of labor. According to them  the switch is fine and the motor is fine and they said that they moved the window up by manually applying the battery to the motor. They didn’t show me what they did and had disconnected the wire going into the motor.I have checked the voltage coming to the faulty passenger side window motor and have compared it with the voltage with the driver side window motor. Both wires seem to get the same voltage but the polarity is reversed. Multi-meter red wire to motor red wire and multi-meter black wire to motor green wire shows positive voltage while the close button is pressed on driver side motor but gets similar negative voltage on passenger side motor.When I started troubleshooting it myself  I connected the wire back and pressed the open button. The window opened properly but now it is again stuck in the down position.Does this mean that the motor is fine but the issue is with the regulator? What does the regulator do anyway and where is it located?Also  according to the wiring diagram  there are 4 relays which control the up and down motion of the rear windows - 2 for LH and 2 for RH. Could the problem be with one of the relays? If yes  how do I troubleshoot a relay?

If you are dealing with an electrical problem I wouldn’t remove the regulator unless necessary  removing the regulator will likely disturb the glass adjustment.

The people who built your car know what they are doing and your brother is using what can be called extra care. Look in your manual for the severe use oil changes and see what that says. Not knowing your driving patterns I would think that your manual says 10000 miles or 1 year.I do 7000 miles or 1 year which ever comes first and you can do many oil changes for the price of a new engine.

I could stand 7 000 or even 8 000  but just not 10 000 - maybe it’s that 5th digit. I agree with @VOLVO_V70 - you’re both right  but check that severe service definition and interval if you go for 10 000 and make sure your driving isn’t defined as severe.

If so  it will tell you when to change oil. Normal service  which includes a lot of steady driving with few stops  will be close to 10 000 miles. If you do a lot of stop and go driving where it is hot and dusty  that is severe service  and closer to 5000 miles might be about right. What does your owner’s manual say about severe service oil change intervals?

Changing too frequently can harm the environment and result in extra expenses though. Replacing a timing chain or variable valve timing actuator b/c the oil changes were too infrequent will result in extra expenses too. It’s a compromise only the car’s owner can decide.

Who is right? Who cares? I balance about $45 000 for the vehicle versus $35 for synthetic oil and an OEM filter. Less than $100 extra a year and I’m sure not to have any carbon build up.

If you want to go every 10k after that  its up to you.BUT  my daughter has a 14 Camry that also calls for 10k oil changes. The dealer did the first two at 10 and 20k  I did one at 25k and then another at 35k. On the 35k oil change  I found sludge building up inside the oil filter housing. Been doing 7500 OCI (oil change interval) since.I have had quite a few cars that I have used the 7500 OCI with synthetic oil and never had an engine issue. I kept most for at least 200k miles and none burned much oil  most didn’t burn any. Worse case was one that burned a quart every 1100 miles after 275k on the engine. Been using the 7500 OCI and synthetic oil on most of my vehicles since around 1985.

If you’ve ever heard of or read about oil sludging/coking and/or premature oil consumption then lack of oil changes it the usual cause.Oil consumption is due to the oil control rings seizing in the piston grooves which in turn does not allow them to “breathe” so to speak. I’ve been into countless engines and while the compression rings are usually free moving the oil control rings are not.

That being said I wouldn’t think they would want to take this risk again.Another interesting note are that the impacted engines using synthetic oil or where the oil was changed every 3000 miles didn’t sludge or fail.If you REALLY want to know  do an oil analysis with Blackstone Labs or similar after 5000 miles and get a scientific analysis of just how much life is left in the oil.

I think Toyota just never changed things from when they required 5000 mile oil changes and explain the maintenence reminde coming on every 5000 miles by citing the tire rotation. I find the 5000 reminder useless. I change my oil by time and am on my second set of tires and the tire store wants 6000 rotations (free) to maintain the warranty. I think an oil life monitor would be much more useful and a temperature gauge would be nice but Toyota doesn’t think they are necessary and since they are the best selling brand in the world  most of their customers must not care.

The only way to get them though was with the electronic dash which was either a $1 or 2 000 option  can’t remember. So at any rate I ordered it without and went down and bought a set of gauges for $20 and mounted it under the dash. Voltage  temp  and oil pressure all in one neat little case that looked OEM. So I still had the idiot lights as well as the actual readings of what was going on. My Acura doesn’t even have a voltage gauge so i just plug one of the $15 variety in from time to time just to see. As far as I’m concerned they can dump all the maintenance minders for all I care  plus anything beyond oil changes has to be reset by the dealer and their computer.

Or tensions failure Turns out once the additive pkg burns off the oil isn’t good enough to protect cam chains and chain tensioners…Also Most cars are rusted out but the engine is still in good shape So mfgs are lengthening there oil change times. This also lets them claim a lower cost of ownership…Change your oil often. It’s not worth the wear and tear to have dirty oil running through the engine.
110968,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-valve-stem/110968,Tire Valve Stem,Maintenance/Repairs,||rx350||lexus||,1,RaymondA,We purchase 4 new tires. The next day on the way to Sacramento we got a flat outside of Gorman. We stopped in Bakersfield to get a new tire and we got another flat on the new tire  same rim  20 miles later. The tire store said they could not find anything wrong with the rim. We returned the first flat to the first tire store and had them inspect the rim. They also could not find anything wrong with the rim. They said it was the valve stem. But two flats on two new tires on the same rim? They replaced all the valves with high-pressure valves. So far  5 days later we have not had a problem. I don’t want my wife driving with a bad spare. If it is the valve stem that means two different tire stores put bad valves on new tires or used same old valve on both tires. Does this sound reasonable? I cant understand how they could have damaged the rim  but 2 flats in 60 miles all on the same rim?13

Blew it up and obviously the valve stem core was leaking. Replaced that one core  and never had another problem with it or the other tires.
110968,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-valve-stem/110968,Tire Valve Stem,Maintenance/Repairs,||rx350||lexus||,6,George_San_Jose1,If the tire store knew the flat tire was newly installed they might not replace the valve stem automatically. So it’s quite possible the only problem was the valve stem was faulty all along. Nothing to do with the rim or the tires. A leaky valve stem will always cause any tire mounted to go flat. I’d guess your shops tested the valve stem for leaks when they installed the new tires on the rims. That’s usually the last test they do. Perhaps the problem was a weird one  where the valve stem didn’t leak on a static test  but when the car is moving it leaked.Just curious  why didn’t you get the flat tire repaired rather than buying a new tire? Was the tire badly damaged by the flat incident ?

110968,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-valve-stem/110968,Tire Valve Stem,Maintenance/Repairs,||rx350||lexus||,9,Nevada_545,The RX350 (listed in the tag) has tire pressure sensors with metal valve stems  they cost about $75 each. The valve stem seals can be replaced when replacing the tires but it usually isn’t necessary.When dismounting tires they remove the valve core and drop it into a tray  perhaps they picked up a damaged or leaky valve core and installed it in your tire valve.On the other hand if you had an RX350 you would know when you had a leaking tire before it went flat.

I was told by the service tech that the cylinder head valve problem was caused by the the faulty piston rings and that it had also damaged the spark plugs. But all of that is beyond the scope of my knowledge on car engines. I just barely understand what the piston rings do. The problem was diagnosed by the dealership service department – I just showed up with 2 engine lights on. It had also been regularly serviced. And I don’t know much about the particulars of the lawsuit. I was just told by the dealership that this was something Honda had extended the warranty on. Thanks for the input on the machine shop. I just wasn’t sure how long something like this took.
90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,7,Nevada_545,There are a lot of unknown factors such as when the vehicle was diagnosed  when the repair was approved by Honda and how long it takes to get the parts. A technician typically won’t begin on an engine project until the parts arrive. Sometimes it takes longer to get approval for a warranty repair then it does to perform the repair.Your service adviser should be able to to update you on the status of your vehicle.Here is some information from the Honda bulletin;American Honda is announcing a powertrain warranty extension as a result of a settlement of a class captioned  Soto etal V American Honda Motor Co.  Inc.  Case No. 3:12-cv-1377-SI (N.D. Cal.).The piston rings on certain cylinders may rotate and align which can lead to spark plug fouling. This can set DTCs P0301 through P0304 and cause the MIL to come on.American Honda is extending the powertrain warranty to cover repairs related to engine misfire (that triggers DTCs P0301 through P0304) to 8 years with unlimited mileage from the original date of purchase and has settled a class action based on this remedial measure.

My car was dropped off with an appointment on July 16  but I don’t know how long it sat before the diagnosis  etc. My frustration is with the dealership in not answering questions and saying  “It should be ready in a few days” several times and the days have taken weeks. But it helps having this input – knowing this that they may have had to wait for Honda approval and parts for awhile. Thank you for the help!
90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,9,ok4450,If the person at the dealership who told you that the valve  or valves  were damaged due to oil consumption and plug fouling then they are dead wrong. Odds are this was a service writer and the vast majority have little mechanical knowledge or understanding so they wing it so to speak.If only the cylinder head is being serviced and there’s a valve problem at 70k miles  in most cases that is due to incorrect valve lash; meaning the lash is too tight and which causes the valve and valve seat to burn.A misfire due to valve lash/burnt valve is not the same as a misfire due to plug fouling due to oil consumption past the piston rings.
90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,10,George_San_Jose1,The work being done for your Honda is a type of major engine repair. Seldom do engines w/only 70K miles on them need this type of repair  so you had a bit of bad luck on this one. It’s good though that Honda is stepping up and not charging your for it  so consider that a big boost to your wallet anyway.A little tutorial might help. Almost all gasoline engines are designed this way. The pistons are shaped like mushrooms and move up and down in the cylinders. A 'cylinder" is shaped like a drinking glass  right. So think of a big mushroom being pulled to and fro in a drinking glass. The wide part of the mushroom moves directly up and down against the cylinder wall  and is tightly pressed to the wall by the piston rings  which are circular springs that go around the big part of the mushroom  and spring out against the cylinder wall to hold it tight.The “rings” are just called that  but they aren’t actually “rings”. They’re like trick magician’s rings. They’re not actual complete circles  they are semi-circles  with an opening  a circle w/a small gap in other words. The gap is what makes it possible to fit the spring over the mushroom. There’s 3 or 4 of these semi-circles all together  and the gaps in the rings must not align  otherwise the aligned gaps create a path for oil to leak past the set of 4 rings. Apparently somehow in your Honda’s engine the gaps were aligning.Since this is a complicated repair  you should expect it to take some considerable time. 2 months wouldn’t be that unusual  depending on parts and machine shop availability. The dealership should be able to give an approximate forecast how long it should take though.Here’s an idea: You might argue that since they haven’t provided you an accurate forecast for the garage time needed to effect the repair  Honda should provide you a loaner car in the meantime. Beyond that  I wouldn’t push them too much. It is better for it to take longer and be done correctly than take less time and done incorrectly.

I finished driving home (about 7 miles) and had it towed to the dealer. The dealer updated the PCM software and replaced spark plugs. The work order also reflects that there’s possible additional work that will have to be done if the problem happens again. That work would involve cleaning the pistons  and replacing the piston rings and spark plugs. The work order cites the Soto class action lawsuit.The suit is news to me (although Honda says they forwarded a notice of class action a while ago). I spoke with Honda’s customer relations office and the dealer. I understand from the dealer that  regardless of when I learned about the suit  there’s nothing they could have done until I experienced a problem.Needless to say  I’m not happy  and I’m a loyal Honda owner (this is my 5th Honda  albeit the first one with a six cylinder engine). I was (and still am) hoping to keep this car for a while. It has about 88 000 miles on it.As part of the settlement of the class action  Honda extended the power train warranty to eight years from date of purchase  as I understand it. I also have an 8 year/120K Honda Care warranty  so  in theory  I should be covered until May 2018 if the problem crops up again. After that  I guess I’m on my own.What I’m wondering is whether the initial repair likely fixed the problem  or whether the problem is likely to crop up again. I’m also wondering if my engine has likely suffered any damage as a result of the issue. I’m curious hearing about others’ experiences.I need to figure out whether I should plan to trade in the car prior to May 2018.Commenters on another board to which I posted suggested having something called a VCMuzzler installed.Any guidance is appreciated.Thanks very much.Chris

It’s been awhile since I had the problem and at the time I barely understood what it was. All I can say is that my car was in the shop for about 5 weeks. Honda covered all costs for repairs and also covered the cost of a rental car for that time period. I will say that I called the dealership numerous times (the service department and manager) and Honda care many times. I didn’t have an extended warranty so Honda care wasn’t much help but the department manager of my Honda dealership was helpful – I’m not sure if it was because I called so often (and was a squeaky wheel) but he was very helpful. Since that time (Aug '15) I haven’t had any problems. I am at 115  000 and my check engine light hasn’t come on and it seems to be running fine.

I have a Honda Pilot 2010  and I kept it very clean with only 65K miles  maintained all the service record from dealerships. Two weeks ago  the VSA and engine lights came up. I took the car to McDavid Honda in Plano Texas  where they diagnosed the “Engine Misfire” problem and told me that it will be covered by the extended warranty. A week later they are saying that the Warranty company wants to see if this issue is due to misuse of the vehicle  and they will not cover the labor cost of bringing down the engine and it will be my responsibility!Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.

90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,22,ok4450,Why should an engine need to be partially or fully disassembled to determine a misfire. Someone is way  way misguided if they have to resort to this.The most obvious would be spark plugs  coils  or worst case; low compression due to a tight valve. The compression issue is easily determined without disassembling any of the engine.The warranty company sounds like a 3rd part outfit and stonewalling any claims are not rare although the TV commercials make it sound like they pay everything presented to them without question. Not.
90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,23,Nevada_545,Unfortunately aftermarket warranty companies don’t pay for “tear down” or inspection fees  you will be responsible for the labor charges if the claim is denied. If the claim is approved the dealer shouldn’t charge a tear down fee.Honda has extended the engine warranty for this problem to 8 years. The delivery date for this vehicle was probably more than 8 years ago  you should check when that was. You may want to contact Honda (the phone # in your owners manual  not the dealer) and ask if the warranty can be applied in this case even if the in-service date was more than 8 years ago. Don’t offer them the information that you have an aftermarket warranty that may pay for this.

Actually I bought this car in November 2010  and am the single owner. I will contact the American Honda Company about the service date. Thanks again.

They have mentioned that inspector from the Warranty company have confirmed the problem and suggested to disassemble the engine to look inside to find the real cause. And they will not be responsible for the 5 hours of labor charges.They have given me the phone number of the warranty company to deal with them directly. I am not sure how would I convince them against their inspector’s diagnosis. Thanks again.

This is their standard procedure  because of the known problem it is doubtful that they will be able to deny the claim but they will try.Honda corporation can confirm your in-service date  if you are the first owner it should be the date when you bought the vehicle but if this is a vehicle that a buyer purchased then back out of the deal the in-service date may have been recorded at that time.It is your service writers duty to check for warranty eligibility but sometimes they fail to check because of a difference in profit  Honda pays 9 hours labor for this repair but the service department may be able to get 20 to 30 hours of labor from the warranty company.
90836,https://community.cartalk.com/t/honda-pilot-cylinder-misfire/90836,Honda Pilot Cylinder Misfire,Maintenance/Repairs,||repair||,27,Farid_Haq,Here is the conclusion. I end up paying $1800 from my pocket to fix piston problem caused by the VSA system. I spoke to service manager and American Honda  and both accepted the fault in the part but did not pay for the full repair. Mcdavid Honda gave $700 discount toward the repair.

Do you mean the way you discovered there was a problem is b/c the VSA warning light turned on? If so  it probably turned on b/c the computer determined there was a problem with the engine  not the other way around.

I have 2009 honda oddesey having a misfire p0303. I didnt know about warrenty extension in 2016 so I put the car in local repair shop to change sparkplug and ignition coil with my pocket. But now the engine sign and vsa warnign showed up again and I jist heard about warrenty extensio of honda misfire. I contact honda customer service center. They said I am out of warrenty and no responsible at all… omg what do i have to do. I am single mom who doesnt have any idea about vehicle… plz help any advice.

There’s one customer interest bulletin that could possibly be related  but seems unlikely.09-042  camshaft position sensor problem due to excess camshaft thrustYour misfire problem most likely has nothing to do with the piston rings rotating into ill-advised alignment. When you hear hoof-beats  think first of horses  not zebras. Misfires are usually cuased by ignition system problems  so ask your shop to start there. This problem is usually diagnosed by swapping ignition parts around  and seeing the problem follows the swap to a different cylinder. Spark plugs  spark plug wires  and coils are where to start. If you see that particular spark plug is oil fouled or otherwise much different than the other three  then indeed you may have piston ring problem. But don’t assume it at this point. Best of luck.BTW  if you’ll post your problem as a separate thread  you’ll get more answers here. Click “maintenance/repairs” above left  the “new topic” above right.Edit: I do see reference to a misfire related bulletin 13-080 dated 05/18/16  here it is.2.58 MBApparently owners of the affected cars were mailed a notice in October 2013. In any event  that 8 extended warranty appears to have expired.

So you changed the valve cover gaskets? Why do you think that helped reduce blow-by gasses to the intake?Crankcase pressure supposed to be no more than 3 psi and you have 3 psi? Right at the limit? Yeah  that isn’t good. You don’t know if you have good rings or not. Pressure in the crankcase can come form more than just blow-by past the rings. It will take a compression test to confirm if the rings are good or bad. If they are good  the crankcase evap system isn’t doing its job. These engines tend to fail their PCV valve and sometimes clog the PCV hose. [ I heard reprograming ecu to ajust valve lap ] Valve “lap”?? You mean valve overlap? Or the variable valve timing? If GM didn’t issue a TSB on that  a certified mechanic wouldn’t touch that.

Ask your friends  family  co-workers  fellow church-goers  etc which shop they use. From there  choose one that specializes in Toyota/Lexus or at least Asian cars. And be sure to tell the shop you choose who it was that recommended you. Gives you a little leverage.

Maybe it just needs improved clamping. When you try again  suggest to place witness marks exactly where you’ve got it positioned  and monitor daily to see if the placement is moving.

How it makes it’s way into an actual sound you can hear  don’t know. But if you could figure that out  it might help to determine what’s wrong. On newer cars that sound often comes from the stereo system speaker. Suggest the first step is to take a length of old garden hose  use as a stethoscope to poke around here and there in the engine compartment see if you can figure out where exactly that sound is coming from. If it is coming from the speaker  the problem could be in the stereo system electronics or its interface to the body control module. A dealership is obviously the place to ask about that. Perhaps there is a software update for the body control module or for the stereo system available.Edit: I’ve been able to confirm the turn signal and hazard light audio sound comes from the body control module and is most likely played through the car’s audio system. The “front controls interface module” is involved  as well as the body control module. Simple implementations of stuff like this in newer cars are rare unfortunately.Comparing the hazard signal audio vs the turn signal audio might be helpful.

Again  the first click is the actuating of the signal via movement of the stalk  the last click is the completion of the signal  or the return of the stalk to it’s original and neutral position. The second click occurs during the turn and is annoying to him.I have spoken to a dealership and one of the service reps supposedly went to look at another vehicle  returned and said there was nothing out of the ordinary. Seems I will need to visit another dealer and see for myself what another 2018 does. Not that I distrust the rep but I’d rather know for certain by witnessing myself.Thanks to all for the help.

For example  if you signal left or right and only change lanes gradually  the signal sometimes does not disengage automatically. When making a 90-degree change of direction (as at an intersection)  the signal always disengages automatically. Could some mechanical action be taking place in the steering column that triggers the second click when passing a minimum point at which the signalling is FORCED to disengage automatically?

Have your UNCLE go back to the SALESPERSON that handled his sale and have them do a ride along. Then if there is something amiss they could intervene with the service department. But  of course  there are good sales people that want to keep you as a customer and ones that don’t care. Hopefully his is the former  not the latter.

I know many of us are frustration. They call it an “idiot light” for a good reason. This is the second year with this problem. It’s believed to be a false signal/a quirk. HELP!17
22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,2,ok4450,The CEL is not an idiot light. The car is attempting to talk to you so you should listen to it.Providing a tiny iota of detail might help in someone formulating an answer. What kind of car  how many miles  CEL on steady or flashing  has the car been scanned  reason for the failure  etc.
22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,3,Caddyman,Many auto parts stores will scan your computer for trouble codes for free. Then at least you will know WHY the light is on…You should also write your state rep. and ask him to sponsor a bill to REPEAL the safety and emissions inspection program unless the people who promote it CAN PROVE it makes any difference in highway safety or air quality. They can’t. Many states with no inspections have a better safety record and better air quality…
22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,4,ok4450,Caddyman  there’s something I’ve always wondered about and have never taken the time to research it. What’s polluting more; half a dozen old simple  carbureted cars that are able to be maintained (cheaply) by their owners or half a dozen late models that have been running around with the Check Engine Light on for the last 3 years? My guess would be the latter.I always thought it somewhat amazing  or even comical  that an 1984 Subaru sedan with a 1.8 carbureted engine w/5 speed manual would get 40 MPG and a 1986 Subaru sedan with a 1.8 port fuel injected engine w/5 speed manual would get less than 30. Both cars were essentially the same size and weight with the 86 being more aerodynamic yet the earlier “crude one” would go 10-12 miles farther on the same amount of fuel.

22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,6,hellokit,No ONE  in the U.S. of A.  can get their car through the emissions test when a check engine (OR  safety related) light is on. It’s FEDERAL law  not State. Further  only one monitor (two  on older cars) “not run” are allowed.It’s possible for something transient to set a code in the engine computer. If you really believe it’s a momentary glitch  a few days before the test is to be performed  disconnect the battery  or let an auto parts store scan for codes  and erase the light. If it is just a temporary glitch  the light will stay off until next year. If not  get your car repaired.

My 19 year old 1989 Honda Accord has over 480 000 miles on it. I maintain it and keep it in tune.

This is not a nightmare  just get the car fixed. The check engine light went on  and you want to ignore it. The emissions station will not  under penalty of law  and your stuck  still refusing to see a mechanic.PS. only idiots ignore the CEL.
22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,10,Caddyman,Typically  only 3%-4% of all cars tested FAIL the emissions test. FORGET repairing them so they pass (at least until the next “test” is completed) but instead TAKE THEM OFF THE ROAD  PERIOD. Even this drastic action would produce NO MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL AIR QUALITY !!! As bad as these cars may be  not enough of them FAIL THE TEST to make ANY difference in overall air quality.Therefore  emissions testing accomplishes NOTHING other that providing jobs for the testers and a revenue stream for the State…California has NO safety inspection program. They enjoy a LOWER accident rate per mile driven than most of the Eastern states that still cling to this useless hassle endured by many motorists who have been brainwashed into believing “It keeps the roads a lot safer” when it FACT it accomplishes NOTHING. You can not prove statistically or any other way that “Safety Inspections” make any difference in “Highway safety” …

It is trying to tell you something is wrong. It might be nothing more than a sensor has a loose connection  or it could mean your engine will be damaged if you fail to take needed action now.Along with the light there is a code that tells us a lot about why the light came on. Get the code and lets go from there. Some auto part stores will read it and give you the results for free.

Most of the safety inspection in NH prior to emissions is brakes  muffler  tires  defrost functional  rust  and frame rust inspection. NH recently added a code read for OBD-II vehicles. So you can still tinker away with your oldie if it has not turned to rust.

22607,https://community.cartalk.com/t/new-york-state-inspection-nightmare/22607,New York State Inspection nightmare,Maintenance/Repairs,||bronco||ford||,16,George_San_Jose1,When the check engine light is on there’s almost certainly something wrong that needs to be corrected. If the problem is addressed promptly the car will be more reliable  safe  and emit less air pollution  so dealing with it is better for you  your car  and the rest of us. One problem with state inspection and emissions testing is the state is not very helpful when you fail. They could for example tell you that when this particular car has failed for other owners with the same failure  the reasons were … most frequent reason … to … least frequent reason. But they don’t provide that sort of information  which makes the car owner feel vulnerable. That’s a problem with the state and its testing system  not the idea of inspecting cars regularly to make sure they are safe to drive for everyone concerned. I’m not sure why states take such a hands-off approach to all this. You’d think they’d want to do all they can to help the car owner get the car’s problems addressed so it will pass.

Or do you neglect maintaining your car so that every inspection you need brakes  steering components or other safety items? If you suspect you are being sold things you don’t need  do what I do. I go to an oil change place near my house that does inspections. The only repairs they do are light bulbs  wiper blades and batteries and the battery is not part of the inspection.I also check my lights and wipers before I go. I also check my brakes   steering and suspension. but I realize most people can’t do that.
124715,https://community.cartalk.com/t/wrong-spark-plugs/124715,Wrong spark plugs!,Maintenance/Repairs,||alero||oldsmobile||,1,Nikki_Stevens,My car started missing. Had the computer read and it stated failure in cylinder #3 and ignition coils. Replaced spark plugs  boots  and ignition coils. Started and it ran worse than before. Figured out that they gave me the wrong spark plugs; took them back and got the right ones. Replaced them and it runs really crappie but not as bad as before. It really sounds like it’s jumped timing; I don’t have this confirmed because I can’t drive it and haven’t been able to get anyone to come read the computer again and check it out. My question is… Can the wrong spark plugs cause it to jump timing… and if not what else should I be looking at? It’s a 2.4ltr and they gave me the spark plugs for the v6… don’t know if it makes a difference. Also it was started 1 time with the wrong plugs and blew 3 plugs back out; 2 3 &45
124715,https://community.cartalk.com/t/wrong-spark-plugs/124715,Wrong spark plugs!,Maintenance/Repairs,||alero||oldsmobile||,2,oldtimer_11,If you replaced 3 plugs and 3 of them blew out when you started the engine  this job is clearly beyond you. Either you didn’t put the plugs in correctly or someone severely damaged the threads in the head.Either get help from someone who is experienced working on cars or tow it to a shop.
124715,https://community.cartalk.com/t/wrong-spark-plugs/124715,Wrong spark plugs!,Maintenance/Repairs,||alero||oldsmobile||,3,Mustangman,I looked up the plugs on Rockauto. It looks like the 4 cylinder plug is longer than the V6 plug. The V6 plug wouldn’t run as well but it should not cause damage. In any event  it wouldn’t cause the car to jump timing.If it actually blew 3 plugs out  that is your problem. The threads on those cylinders are likely damaged and the engine won’t run right until inserts are installed to fix the threads. Agree with @oldtimer_11  this seems beyond your skills.

So the reliability will likely depend on which yours is. For the non-turbo there’s recalls on the navigation system  air filter housing  clutch slave cylinder  and XE relay socket. The only one of those that looks problematic is the clutch slave cylinder  which likely requires removal of the transmission. So make sure that’s been done. Besides clutch issues & some expected niggles you’d see in any high end sports car like this  looks pretty reliable to me. There’s apparently a lack of available of replacement cylinder heads for engine replacements if that matters to you. Make sure only Porsche-approved engine and transmission lubricants have been used of course. As w/any low slung sports car  parts are a little more expensive and replacement usually takes more time than an econobox. $350 parts + 4 hours to replace the water pump for example. So budget for that. [ Ask the owner if the IMS bearing or the entire has been replaced ] Just curious  what does the IMS bearing do?

The purpose of the intermediate shaft is to drive the camshafts indirectly off the crankshaft.Clipped in from a Porsche site. Its the “on the flywheel end” that’s the bugger.

124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,1,sciconf,When vehicle is driven  what pressure I should inflate the tires to? One guy at tire shop said +3psi - so 38psi - the guy inflated said it will be bumpy. Mine is 2013 Mazda 5 - Factory says 35psi.When I was on freeway (38psi) it felt as if I didn’t have the benefit of the tire (it was so hard) - car was not gripping the road. Besides stuff inside the car was giving resonating vibration.So next day on this trip  I used my finger nails to release the pressure - measured it after driven on freeway and it was 36psi all around!Should I inflate to 35psi regardless? What do you guys do?I do not want the car to float on the road (this is what I felt at 38psi) - I like the car to hug the road as far as possible and not to have a vibrations. Same time  I do not want the tires to wear out unevenly - what is the optimum?17

Normal operating pressure is 3 to 5 PSI above the cold pressure.
124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,6,boilerengtn,I might sound a little snarky - I apologize. This is an issue that is asked but is (unnecessarily  in my mind) made much more complicated than it needs to be - by mechanics and non-mechanics alike. Find a day that you can check them before driving. Saturdays work best for me. Get the recommended pressure from the door. Check them and adjust the pressure if needed. I consider within 3 psi close enough; others will want a tighter tolerance - nothing wrong with that. Repeat the process at some frequency. I find monthly is adequate  although I’ll recheck tires that might have a slow leak after a few days.
124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,7,lion9car,The tires should be at the recommended pressure when they’re cold during the coldest part of the day  so you should measure them first thing in the morning. If you park in a garage  then add 1 PSI for each 10 degrees (Fahrenheit) that the garage is warmer than the outside air to compensate for that.After you drive for a while later in the day  you are likely to be around 38 PSI  but that’s not when you want to set them.

124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,9,jtsanders,This depends on at least two things. One is what sort of driving you just did. If it was unimpeded highway driving for a couple of hours or more  the temperature of the tires should max out. This brings the second issue up  what the air temperature is. If it is 90F or 30F after the highway drive  then the eventual stable tire temperature will be different  leading to different tire pressures. I don’t want to mess around with all that  and will check the pressure when the tires are at ambient temperature.
124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,10,BillRussell,I always set the tires 2-3 PSI above the recommended value  for two reasons.If I set it at recommended value  and the temperature falls  the result will be an underpressured tire  not a safe condition. Whereas setting it a few PSI high gives me a margin if the temp falls. 2 PSI is a 20ºF margin.Increased MPG at a slight expense of ride comfort.
124181,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-pressure-when-is-hot/124181,Tire pressure when is hot?,Maintenance/Repairs,||mazda5||mazda||,11,CapriRacer,The car shouldn’t perceive much difference between 35 and 38 psi. I wonder what was going on there.Hot tire pressures should be no more than 10% greater than the cold pressure. So a 35 psi cold tire should rise to no more than 38 1/2 psi. If one experiences more than that  there is something wrong and at the very least  slow down. If you experience more than a 15% buildup  you need to take immediate action - more load carrying capacity (more pressure  larger tire!)Nowadays  vehicle manufacturers properly size the tires on their vehicles (Not so in the past)  so with the exception of trailers  this should not be an issue. Why trailers? Because while cars were all changed by the 1990’s and trucks and SUV’s by 2008  trailer manufacturers were slow to pick up on this - and maybe even today  there are some who haven’t.

Drive to the nearest place with air  in the cool of the morning  inflate to 35 and you are good to go.Check every month. They will likely lose a little (1-2 psi) unless you are heading into summer where they may gain 1-2 psi. Let some out to get to 35. Don’t obsess about 34 or 36 psi  that’s close enough if you aren’t near air.

I don’t inflate above that at all  b/c the ride feels too bumpy when the tires are overinflated. If you want to optimize  start at 38 psi  then gradually decrease by 1 psi at a time  until arrive at the performance trade-off you like.

I recently responded on another forum to someone who claimed a 1 psi change in tire fill pressure made their car go from OK to unbearable.

One side of the car was facing the shaded park we’d camped in. The other side squarely faced the rising sun. The pressure in the sun-warmed tires was noticeably higher than the shaded side.

If the seal is not sealing  that could be letting excess gas into the carb. On today’s cars that might be compensated for by the electronics and the idle air control motor. But not so on a carb.The accelerator pump on my 1979 Toyota 4X4 had a leather seal that moved up and down in a cylinder - like a bike pump. I had to soak that seal in oil from time to time. It also had an AAP auxiliary accelerator pump which had a diaphragm with gas on one side and engine vacuum on the other. When that diaphragm failed  excess gas poured into the carb and eventually the oil.

Came back and tested to find it was the alternator. Looked it up and guessed the price would be about $500. He didn’t have what was needed to replace  jumped the car and sent me on my way. I called my grandpa for his CC info bc no way did I have that  and as much fun as it would be to work from Sedona for a few weeks  finding a place to do that and keep the animals sane wouldn’t have been remotely easy -I called another shop  told them my problem and that it would be a pain bc of where it was located. He insisted he could do it. Got to that shop  and waited for a bit before he took the car back. Five minutes later  he couldn’t fix it but he called a shop that said they could fix it and if I got there fast enough  it could be done that day - and it was just a mile away. They jumped the car and sent me on my way.A block away the car totally died. So once again we had to wait for a tow. At that point it was nearly 3pm and I knew it wouldn’t be done. I found out I had trip interruption so my hotel/food would be reimbursed - but if you have pets you know finding a pet friendly hotel is sometimes a challenge. I have a pit  a GSD  and a cat. I was lucky and found the Best Western Inn of Sedona has a flat $20 fee per stay no matter now many or what kind of animal. I used a hotels discount I had been saving and paid $88 for the night.We eventually got to the third shop and got what I needed for the night packed up and they (thankfully!) drove the lot of us to the hotel. He even waited for me to check in and helped carry the stuff to the room.I got the call with the estimate the next morning and they got to work. I also had hem do an oil change since I was there and they topped up all fluids. The cost was so much bc they also had to discharge and recharge the AC to get to the alternator. I have a problem with pump shutoff when I fill up the tank - there is something clogging the line - you can hear it fill up after a half gallon and it shuts off - takes me forever to fill up. They checked that out and couldn’t see anything obvious but didn’t charge me for checking it out. I am sure they could have figured it out if I had more time  but after having to walk a mile with two dogs  a cat in a bag  my camera/purse and lenses  as well as my work laptop bag… and a litter box… I was just ready to leave. It was the longest mile walk of my life.Canyon Auto in Sedona was actually pretty fantastic to deal with! She gave me a list of things to have a shop locally check out for that gas issue and they were upfront and clear about EVERYTHING they did. The itemized receipt showed literally everything they did and they did a full road test check before we started out 3.5 hour drive home.It was a long  crazy weekend. Thanks to everybody here who helped me know what it could be. Not knowing is a huge anxiety point for me.

A Mopar new alternator is $330-370  labor is 2.9 hours  plus shop supplies  tax and free shuttle rides it would cost well over $700. Those dealers are small  they may not have an alternator in stock so you may have to wait overnight for an alternator to be shipped from the Phoenix warehouse  that means spending the night in a hotel.

I immediately pulled over and shut it off. I got out and looked under the hood but there was no steam and no apparent leaks. After a while I started it up and it was normal temp. I drove it home and the next day had it towed into a shop.They said I needed a new thermostat and water pump. Reasonable. So I got it back and it was fine for a while but then started overheating after about 10 minutes driving. But a lot of the time  it would cool off after only a few seconds. This went on for a bit and I took it back to the shop. They topped off the coolant and told me the heater core needed to be flushed  but that they didn’t do that.So after another couple of weeks of this I called around and found a shop to take it to. They said “Oh no  that is not why it is overheating  bring it in for a second opinion.” So I took it in and they did a full flush and refill of coolant.SAME THING. Also - the heat blows ice cold if I am idling or running at low RPMs. Also it takes at LEAST 20 minutes of driving for it to even try to blow warm air. I am getting really tired of paying mechanics to not fix this! Over $1000.00 so far!HELP please!!EDIT TO ADD: Full disclosure. A few months ago the security system started to fail so I had the computer core replaced with an exact duplicate that had been code altered to remove the security check. I had to do this because it would randomly decide not to start because it thought I was trying to steal it. I had to do the reset dance with the keys every time I wanted to drive somewhere which took 10 minutes of sitting there looking like a moron in the car.8

If the car cools off after “only a few seconds ” then I would think that there might be something faulty with your temperature gauge or the sending unit  or the wiring in between.(But this might just be on my mind because I’m fixing a temperature gauge problem on my car. It could be something else  and I’m sure some more experienced mechanic will come along with a good answer.)

An air bubble in the heater core will cause circulation problems and the heater will not warm up. An air bubble will also cause overheating problems as a sizable air bubble will delay the thermostat opening.As to why an air bubble is in the cooling system may be due to a head gssket issue. I didn’t want to say that  but it needed to be said. A way to check is to remove the radiator cap with the engine cold. Make sure it is full by adding coolant if you must. Then  start the engine and watch the coolant. If air bubbles start to rise  have the coolant checked for HC contamination. HCs in the coolant is a sign of a head gasket problem.

Hopefully its just trapped from when they flushed the system. Loosen the cap and see if the air works out

I think it has air. You can stickGM Procedure 4 cylinder Fill the cooling system. Slowly add a mixture of 50/50 DEX-COOL and clean  drinkable water. Important: It is necessary to maintain the coolant level at the top of the surge tank label to insure all the air has been purged from the cooling system. Install surge tank cap. Start the engine. Run the engine at 2 000 - 2 500 RPM until engine reaches normal operating temperature. Allow the engine to idle for 3 minutes. Shut the engine off. Allow the engine to cool. Top off the coolant as necessary.6 Cylinder Open the cooling system bleeder screws Important: Open the cooling system bleeder screws. Slowly fill the cooling system with a 50/50 coolant mixture. Close the cooling system bleeder screws. Install the coolant pressure cap. Start the engine. Run the engine at 2 000 - 2 500 RPM until the engine reaches normal operating temperature. Allow the engine to idle for 3 minutes. Shut the engine off. Allow the engine to cool. Top off the coolant as necessary.

That’s the first priority I think. If it turns out not to be that  remove the thermostat and test it by placing it in a pot of water which you heat up on the stove  and a thermometer measuring the temp. Check that the thermostat opens fully to the dimension it should (find the spec)  and at the correct temperature  and when cold it returns to home fully closed. Also compare it to the original one that came with the car if possible  there are mechanical differences in t-stats and maybe the one installed is not the correct one for your car. Thermostats have to be installed in the correct orientation  front vs reverse  and up and down  that’s another thing to check.

I just fixed my daughter’s 2003 Grand Am GT. The problem is what looks like a relay mounted to the driver’s side fender wall. It’s located directly across from the air filter assembly. Pontiac has located this device there and all your major grounds join here. The mounting plate attached to it becomes corroded which interferes with the grounding signal from the computer to turn on the cooling fans. The bolt that held it in place was actually so rusty that the head of the bolt had broken off as I removed it. I used a circular wire brush attached to my drill to remove the corrosion from the back plate. Used the same brush to create a new bear metal spot on the fender and a self taping screw to reattach it. No more over heating from there on  Fans triggered and varied speed as they should. Also check the O-ring is still in place on the coolant reservoir cap  it cracks and falls off.

This time I noticed that the washer for the oil plug bolt was in my plastic multi purpose oil waste pan when I was draining the old oil into the waste container. No problem-- I’ll just drain the new oil out add the washer to the bolt and refill the oil. What I didn’t realize was that there was a dried latex oil chip about 3/4 x 1/8 inch in the pan. It worked loose from the old warm oil. When refilling the new oil a 2nd time it flowed out into the motor thru the filler pan. So the possibilities are:It will sit at the bottom of the oil pan and flow out during the next oil change. (good)It will be caught by the oil filter and sit in the filter clogging it up a little bit. (no harm done).It will be burnt up by engine heat – no harmIt won’t be caught  won’t burn up  and be caught somewhere important in the engine – ruining it — very very bad.Which is the likely scenerio? Any of the above or something completely different? Should I redrain the oil and see if it comes out? The chip is small I don’t know if that would work.I haven’t driven the car except to get it off the ramp and we’re leaving on vacation tomorrow of course. Thanks for the thoughts.5

One suggestion however for future diy’er oil changes  line the catch pan with a disposable plastic garbage bag liner. Then you don’t have to worry about what’s at the bottom of the pan  it’ll always be clean  and no need to spend time cleaning the pan afterward. Just pop the old filter into the bag and toss the plastic bag in the garbage and you are done.

Or is the problem the corresponding connector on the wiring harness end has been removed for some reason  and is now missing? If that’s the case and a replacement harness connector is difficult to source  an auto electric shop could probably figure out a way to use a different connection method. They might decide is easier to remove the new sensor’s connector and just hard wire it to the harness by soldering  with no connector.

Then there was a 3rd one with only the valve connected that I thought went to what appeared to be grounded wiring. The third valve location is down below the green arrow. I can barely reach it. We removed it and it is an o2 sensor but there’s no female connector to plug it in to

In one configuration (probably for Calif vehicles) they are all a/f sensors (a special type of o2 sensor). The 2 upstreams are located in the front area of the engine (one is near where you draw the red circle). The downstream location ( bank 1 sensor 2) is hard to tell from  the diagram  but is probably similar to the 4 cylinder engine  in the exhaust pipe after the cat  and the connector for it looks to be inside the passenger compartment & require the driver’s seat be removed or at least unbolted.Note: Your terminology “valve” is confusing the issue. For o2 sensor circuits  there’s a “sensor”  and a “connector”. No valves  at least that I’m aware of.

I pulled the downstream off today (the male/female connectors run up under the driver seat) and replaced it. The valve stem was by the catalytic converter.After digging for more info  I have learned that the one I’m having issues with is bank 1 sensor 1. I found the valve location just not where the connector is supposed to go. This is the first car I have ever worked on so bare with me LoL!

Bank 1 sensor 1 is higher up on the engine than bank 2 sensor 1  and biased a little more towards the driver’s side. Do you know if you have a Calif configured car? For O2 sensor configuration  +B to HT should measure 11-16 ohms at room temperature. For A/F sensor  0.8 to 1.4 ohm.Sorry  unable to post any diagrams.

It’s a v6 3.0 LEverything I’ve seen on YouTube shows the plastic connector just above where I screw in the sensor. In the pics here you’ll see the sensor and then what I see above the sensor.

The techs use the drawings as a place to start looking  and often just follow the harness wires based on the wire colors from the wiring schematic to find the sensor they are looking for. Like I say the diagram I found showed both sensor 1’s towards the front of the engine  but it seems hard to believe that’s actually the case on a v-configured transverse mounted engine. That diagram may have been in error  or was showing the locations of the connectors for the sensors  not the sensors themselves. One of the exhaust banks of that configuration is usually between the engine and the firewall; i.e. near the back of the engine compartment. You’re probably going to have to do it the way the techs do  visually follow the wires based on the wire colors to the sensor. The metal clamp you show in the photo above may just be a strain relief for the wiring to the sensor. To prevent the wire insulation from chaffing as the engine vibrates and shorting the sensor out.One bit of info that might be helpful  bank 1 usually corresponds to the exhaust bank used by cylinder number 1. If you know where cylinder number one is  then its exhaust bank is bank 1.If you still want to replace the sensor yourself  it may make sense to take it to a shop and ask them to show you where both sensor 1’s are located.

Due to my husband’s back injury I was hell bent on figuring it out. I even caved and took it to a mechanic and he said oh no you have you get underneath to get to that sensor. So I said screw it I’ll go home and obsess more. I saw people on YouTube do it  I can do it too LoL! I too bought the wrong sensor. Bought a universal one and didn’t open it until I got home. It didn’t come with a male/female connector. I’ve been having to take lyft/Uber to the stores so it’s been quite the hassle. You live and you learn I have been enjoying tinkering with it though!

Recently  when driving over 70 mph on the freeway  the rav jumps up to over 3000 RPMs. Normally in this range  especially without my foot on the gas  this hovers around 2000 RPMs or so (at least to my memory).Any thoughts? We take it in for regular maintenance/oil changes - in fact  just had one a week ago.Maybe it’s just a coincidence  but read it in another thread so thought this worth mentioning too: when entering the freeway  or in any situation where I need to pick up speed quickly  the rav will all of a sudden shift and jump from 2000 RPMs to maybe 3000 or 4000 RPMs. I always figured that the car just had a little trouble accelerating  but other forum members thought otherwise  that it was potentially a transmission issue.1

Is the window motor getting power? If not  probably a wire somewhere has broke  or a switch is faulty  bad ground  etc. The wiring is pretty complex for this function  and this sort of thing will be hard for you to debug without a wiring schematic. Once you get that  you can start at the battery and point by point follow the circuit until you discover where the battery voltage isn’t getting through. It has to be somewhere somewhere between the battery and the window motor.

There’s one on my Corolla for example  which allows the computer to sound an alarm if I open the door with the key still in the ignition. That switch could be sticking or failing. Less likely  but there could be a problem w/the door switch. Check the lights which normally only come on when the door is open to see if they are also coming on when they shouldn’t.

Kind of like that “new” old girlfriend who has decided to start coming around again…Given the modern day lacy of not changing the motor oil frequently and/or never checking the motor oil level I can’t say as that I would ever consider a boneyard motor anymore unless it’s etched in stone that they will conver any and all costs related ot the motor installation.

His fuel was on the low side and we couldn’t get it to start when moved to level ground after filling the tank. His fuel filter was filthy so we changed that as well as the fuel pump. It still wouldn’t turn over. He’s since burnt out the starter and we replaced it. We still can’t get it to turn over and start the engine. Any thoughts?? It had been running normal prior to that night.4

The starter motor turns over the engine - that is  rotates the crankshaft  making the pistons go up and down  the valves open and close  etc.When you turn the key to Run ( not all the way to Start) the fuel pump should run for a few seconds. You many hear it. Does it run? Each you turn the key to Off and back to Run  it should run briefly. Doing this “key dance” can bring fuel and fuel pressure up to the engine. If the fuel pump is not running  the engine will not run  even though it can turn over until the starter motor breaks.If the fuel pump does not run  it could be problem with the fuel pump relay  sometimes called the main relay  which is usually in the dashboard under the instrument cluster.If the fuel pump is running and the key dance doesn’t suffice  the problem may be in the ignition system.

The fuel pump motor comes on  and we get fuel at the fuel injector header. While checking the fuel pump relay  we can feel 3 distinct clicks so we’re not sure it’s the fuel pump relay. We’re about to get a fuel pressure gauge from the auto store to check that. And now in the process of checking spark plugs. Are we missing anything?

Have you confirmed that the timing belt is intact and moving when the starter is cranked ? Have you done a compression test?Diagnosis should come before parts.

There are 3 or 4 fuses involved in this so you might consider checking ALL of the fuses before going too deep into buying parts.The PCM side of the relay could cause a lack of spark.Word of advice. A starter motor should never be kept cranking until it burns out. I assume by “can’t get it to turn over” that you mean it cranks but won’t start. Your post needs to be clarified a bit. There’s a difference because won’t turn over should mean the starter motor will not crank the engine.

I have retired long time ago and and am enjoying my relaxed life. There is no reason to hurry. I was calm and no reason to be excited. I purchased the car about three months ago.Because of the curb and a car about 10 feet ahead from my intended parking space I slowed my car down to the maximum  almost to a stop.Upon reaching the curb I turned the wheel slightly to the left in order to align the car with (parallel to) the curb. There was a car about ten feet in front of my car. I stepped on the accelerator very slightly in order to move the car forward to make some space behind my car for other cars to park. It was around 10 - 11 am. There was no reason at all to step on the accelerator hard to speed.Suddenly the car sped up and I turn the wheel left to avoid the car in front and again to avoid a streetlight pole and then ran into a house.When I came to after a short blackout I managed to move out of the car. The damage to the house and my car was heavy. I reported to the insurance. I want to know if I should report to the regulatory agency for vehicle safety in Ontario or Canada.1

I thought it was the ABS system  but no code came up and it has progressively deteriorated.

I’ve had to replace all the calipers and the rears a couple times. Plus the parking brake assembly. However  when they are repaired  the Highlander has a good firm pedal and it stops very well. Yours has a problem and I suspect it may not be located at the wheels. Volvo’s right. You need a better shop.

After driving it for some time the brakes seem to be locking up. If on the highway  it will start as a vibration in the steering and escalating to shaking and slowing as well as not maintaining speed. In the city it happens after applying breaks a few times. At this point  the brake peddle does not go far to the floor before full braking happens. When this issue is in full effect you and you are moving slow  you can feel a slow/fast rotation. Also  hot stinky brake smell by back wheels when I stop. If you stop and sit in idle and try to go again  the problem is still there.If you turn the car off for a few minutes and restart  it goes away. Our mechanic is perplexed by this. In an effort to find a solution  he took the fuse out of the ABS system and drove it a bit. Thinking it was solved  we took it home. This did not solve the problem. It seems to be getting worse. Any thoughts.7

If they do replace the M/C have the brake fluid changed so crud from the old fluid doesn’t clog the ports in the M/C.

They act like a check valve and don’t let the brake release. If you have experienced this on one wheel  replace ALL of the rubber lines in the system. There might be 3 (with rear drum brakes - not sure if this Subby has disk rears) or 5 - one at each corner and one in the middle of the axle. If one has failed the rest are close behind so just do all of them.Carefully check the metal brake lines as well because these lines tend to rust apart right near the ABS unit. A full line set is available for a few hundred and a clever mechanic can replace them without dropping the gas tank and leaving the old  disconnected line in place.

I took a look at the front end of the car to figure out how it works. I could see something that looked like a diode laser attached to the lower radiator area  and pointing forward so it was aiming through a portion of the front grill. Is that how it works  just a single laser? I Googled Toyota’s website expecting to see it uses radar  but it suggests there’s just a camera and a laser. I couldn’t see any camera. Just what appeared to be a laser. Anybody know how it works? And where those anti-collision gadgets are located on the car?19

Police have been using laser with or instead of radar for a long time to catch speeders. Much tighter beam  easier to focus on a target area.

I next Googled what a mm wave radar sensor looks like on a Texas Instruments Corp website  but what I saw didn’t look like that.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely  it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes  PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist (BA). 27 If you don’t brake in time  it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed  helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.Maybe what I saw that looked like a laser diode is actually the camera  and the radar sensor is somewhere nearby.

To detect people as well  radar would be better suited is my guess.

The mm wave radar sensor looks to be in the front grill area  but higher up (near the hood latch)  not where the gadget I thought was a laser diode. That must be some other kind of sensor.Good luck to a diy’er if that system ever goes on the fritz …

The systems are working great based on real-world testing. They take very little getting used to and false positives have been reduced quite a bit in just a handful of years. Almost evry car now has a high-mounted camera above the rear-view mirror. I am posting an image of the camera in a Subaru. The radar is almost always just behind the grill and most automakers now use a logo as the cover for it.

Rented an 18 Camry last fall with "enhanced " cruse control and some sort of “collision avoidance” “feature”. Driving on a 4 lane freeway through rolling hills of Illinois the car constantly shifted down going up gentle grades and again going down: 8-7-6-7-8-7-6-7-8…About drove me crazy. The worst however was in minimal traffic while following a semi in the right lane. I’m watching a car approach in the left lane while I’m creeping up on the semi. I’m calculating the differential speeds of the 3 of us and planned to move out into the left lane behind the passer on my left and follow him past the truck. Not obstructing any of us.The damn computer decides I’m too close to the semi ( 10 car lengths maybe) and slows down my car. I eventually figured out how to turn off this “feature” and never used the cruse again. I’m old and I’ll probably never buy another new car  certainly not one with this sort of “safety feature” on it. Help strikes again.

You will probably get a code for an output speed sensor along with gear ratio codes. This transmission is famous for speed sensor failures. What is happening with yours is the output speed sensor is most likely bad so the information it is relaying to the transmission computer is not consistant. This confuses the computer  the computer then puts the transmission in limp mode. This is why its not shifting. Take it to one of your local auto parts stores and have them scan the computer for codes. They usually scan for free. Post back here with the code/s and we will go from there. If it is indeed the output speed sensor  go buy BOTH the input and output speed sensors and change them.transman

Those sensors commonly go bad on these transmissions. If you do have any other issues with it it would be in the wiring because the connectors commonly give problems. The P-0700 (Trans control system) is a generic code telling you that the computer has picked up error codes in the TCM having to do with the transmission. The reason I recommended replacing BOTH input and output sensors is that first of all they both commonly fail. Second of all they both work together in the shifting of the transmission. The transmission computer take the readings from both sensors  the turbine shaft speed and the output shaft speed  it then converts both readings into a gear ratio. When the computer sees a gear ratio which is programmed into the computer it will shift the transmission. If it does not see one of the pre programmed gear ratios  it will throw an error code for that gear and place the trans into limp mode. With yours  the computer was detecting erratic readings coming from the output speed sensor  first gear never reached a pre programmed ratio so both of those codes appeared. The speedo receives its info from the output speed sensor so thats how the speedo became involved. And the third reason I recommended changing both sensors is that they are so cheap anyways. Dont worry about mixing them up when you change them because they have different threads on them  one is coarse thread and the other is fine thread.transman

If you have access to a scanner  use it because you are going to need to monitor some live data. Monitor your input and output readings while you drive. In 3rd gear both readings should be the same. Also while stopped  monitor your output reading while wiggling the output sensor connector. See if you get any erratic readings.transman

Whatever you do  do NOT go to a chain-run trans shop like Lee Myles  Cottman  Mr. Transmission  or–GOD forbid–AAMCO.

Since the P0716 code refers to a circuit problem for that sensor you need to check the wiring to it and make sure the proper voltages are present at the sensor. Power most likely isn’t getting to the sensor.

My mechanic felt the car was behaving like it was low on fluid or the filter was clogged (I concur)  I would tell you it has no dipstick and is a sealed system. It’s only serviced like after 75K or problems exist. He did find it was a quart low  but he could not pull the filter as it required a special tool he didnt have. Now things get messy Cougar. I tell the shop I want the filter changed before we deal with sensors and he tells me the tranny has to be pulled to change the filter (I’m immediately suspect). I call the GMC dealer and they charge $199 to change the filter  $1050 to replace the “Input Speed Sensor” because the tranny does have to be dropped to replace that sensor ($985 labor). This means my new tranny shop owner friend bold-face lied to me. GMC would not charge only $199 for filter replacement if they had to drop the tranny. I assume it’s time to have my car towed elsewhere? Thank you

It does appear that this model has a more complex system since it doesn’t even have a dipstick to check fluid levels. The dealer quoted me $199 to change the filter and the tranny shop claims they have to pull the entire tranny just to change the filter. Someone’s not being straight with us.

The fault code you gave tells me that there is something wrong with the sensor circuit wiring and the sensor itself is most likely fine. If it was my vehicle I would make sure that the wiring to that sensor was completely checked out before doing anything further. I suspect a problem will be found with the wiring and after that is fixed no more codes will appear and things will run normally  but I could be wrong.

Let this be a lesson to anyone with tranny-related codes. When he told me he could do it for just $3 000 (but there might be a $700 part needed he could get me for just $375) I couldn’t tow it fast enough. I hear you  my guys dropped the tranny case and replaced the input speed sensor (I had it anyway)  found out the dealer charges $500 to do the tranny filter…$500 for a tranny filter! Anyway  I’ll have them check the wiring harnesses  hopefully it’s not too hard to find which goes to the PCM  my guys aren’t exactly the type that read shop manuals  just good  honest mechanics that do free stuff for me all the time  never charge me for OBD scans  fluid etc I try to do the tech legwork with you fine gentlemen. Hopefully they can still run a scan after the speed sensor replacement but before they close up the tranny. Thanks for all your help again

Spray it briefly into the air intake  while cranking  with all the spark plugs installed and hooked up. If you get a brief firing up  that tells you you have a fuel delivery problem. Could be fuel pump relay not working  or ignition switch  etc.

You may hear it. Don’t turn the key all the way to Start until you’ve done a few cycles of this “key dance.”The idea is to bring fuel and fuel pressure up to the engine. A leaking injector or a leaking anti-drainback valve in the fuel supply line or fuel pump assembly can cause this condition.

I have a 2007 Honda CR-V  2.4L  135 000 miles. A coupe months ago I started having issues where the car would intermittently crank slowly or not at all. Waiting a couple minutes always fixed it. I checked the battery at the time and it was on the low end of the acceptable range (435 CCA  I believe)  so I figured I’d replace it when it got worse.The issue more or less went away until today. I drove to the grocery store from work without issue  but there  it wouldn’t start (same slow/no crank  but no improvements). It also wouldn’t jump-start. I bought a new battery and hooked it up (correctly)  but the problem persisted. I ended up having it towed back to my place.What’s my next step? A bad starter’s always a possibility  but I always thought that was mainly a stripped gears thing-(high pitched whirring  no cranking). Can a starter fail in the manner I experienced  or should I be looking elsewhere in the electrical system?Thanks as always for your help.7

If that doesn’t help then check the voltage getting to the starter while cranking the engine. You should see at least 10.5 volts there if the battery is fully charged and the cable to the starter has no issues like internal wire corrosion at the battery clamp due to acid leaching into the cable. The starter could have a problem also and may be drawing excessive current. A shop would have to verify that.

In the quiet of the morning (as opposed to the noisy parking lot I was in last night)  I could tell the relay was clicking on  so I tried starting it a couple dozen times in rapid succession (hey  might as well shorten the life of that new battery  right?). it went from no crank to slow crank to normal  and started up. I’ve been able to restart it repeatedly now.I know the problem’s not fixed-I didn’t do anything to fix it-but further diagnostic will have to wait until it acts up again. I’ll check the voltage at the starter next time it acts up.

There’s parts inside the starter that spin each time you crank the engine  and the orientation they end up after the crank affects how robust it will crank the next time. Sort of like a slot machine. You’ve been hitting some cherries on the reel of late. But eventually you’ll get a string of X’s  and it won’t crank. You know that’s going to happen at the worst possible time. If you absolutely want to avoid the possibility of replacing a good starter  you’d have to do the voltage tests mentioned above. But if I had the symptom myself  and the battery tested good & the starter was more than 5 years old  I’d just replace the starter.

I changed both sides  and the side that was creaking had deformed bushings. I suspect when I installed them five years ago I didn’t do it quite right. I also replaced the sway bar links  and put silicone grease on all the bushings  including the sway bar bushings. 600 miles later  and no creaking so far! Thanks for all the help.

I know that this is counterintuitive  but it is the reality of the combination of those 2 warning lights.I would suggest getting the car to a mechanic before you kill the battery and before you become stranded.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,3,DoggyKarma,Could it be something less expensive than that? Or is definetly the alternator?Thank you
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,4,mcparadise,Most auto parts stores will test the battery and alternator free. Don’t guess; find out. It only takes a few minutes to test the alternator.If the alternator is faulty the battery won’t last very long. Don’t delay. Have someone test the alternator ASAP before you’re stranded somewhere.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,5,VDCdriver,Trust me. Been there  done that. It IS the alternator.The longer you delay in search of the answer that you want (rather than the correct answer)  the greater the probability that you will kill the battery and become stranded in an inconvenient place  thus needing a flatbed truck to get you to a mechanic. Remember that your Subaru cannot be safely towed!The possible good news is that alternator replacement might be covered by Subaru. On my old '97 Outback  the alternator failed (after producing the same symptoms as your car) and even though all warranties on the car had expired long before  the dealership announced that there was no charge  as many Subarus of that era had also suffered from alternator failure. It turned out that the supplier of alternators had manufactured a run of bad ones  and because they had to make monetary amends to Subaru  Subaru provided free repair to its customers.You did not provide us with the model year of your Outback (ALL details on a vehicle should be provided when asking a question!!!)  so I do not know if your car is one that might be covered by the “free replacement” policy.However  if you call the dealer’s service department and provide them with the VIN  they can tell you if you are covered for free alternator replacement. Then  no matter whether you take it to the dealership or to an independent mechanic  get this taken care of immediately because otherwise  you will be stranded within a matter of a day or two.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,6,DoggyKarma,It is an '02 Outback - I bought it used 2 years ago and have had so many problems wtih it. Just spent 2K this year and last year 1 500 on a transmission  so I am just scared.Thanks for all the help -
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,7,VDCdriver,My '02 Outback has been even more trouble-free than my '97 Outback was  thus leading me to believe that yours was poorly maintained (or not maintained at all) by the previous owner.For instance  if the transmission fluid had been changed at 30k and at 60k–as it was supposed to–it is very unlikely that you would have experienced transmission problems. My old '97 Outback  which is now in the hands of a relative  has over 160k on the odometer  and the transmission is still working flawlessly. My '02 Outback continues to operate like new in every way  most likely because I maintain the car very carefully.After you take care of the alternator problem  I would strongly suggest that you take a look at the maintenance schedule that is (hopefully) sitting in the glove compartment. Make sure that ALL maintenance is up to date  including the timing belt if yours is a 4-cylinder model. Remember that all maintenance procedures have an odometer mileage value AND an elapsed time value  with the proviso  “whichever comes first”.Even if the previous owner did not maintain the car properly  you can limit further damage by trying to play catch-up with maintenance at this point.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,8,DoggyKarma,Thanks everyone for all the help. I was able to get to a mechanic today and it was as you said the alternator. Not happy about spending the money but it’s fixed and I’m not stranded.As far as things being taken care of - yes  good point. Just frustrated  not upset with Subaru.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,9,Cougar,Glad to hear you got it fixed and hope you don’t have any more troubles for a long time now. The reason the warning lights turn on is due to the design of the warning light circuit. They are tied to the alternator field circuit and this allows the lights to be tested when the the key is turned to ON.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,10,VDCdriver,I’m glad that I was finally able to convince you that the alternator was on its way out.Now  please follow up with my recommendation that you go through the maintenance schedule and make sure that ALL of the maintenance for the car’s odometer mileage and/or the age of the vehicle has been taken care of. It DOES make a difference  and it will be cheaper in the long run than having to replace failed components.
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,11,AWW,i am having the same problem. The battery tests out OK and the alternator is putting out about 12.75 volts. I seem to recall that 13.5 is recommended so is 12.75 enough difference to make the battery light come on and the battery to discharge while driving?
32439,https://community.cartalk.com/t/subaru-outback-warning-lights/32439,Subaru Outback - Warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||hyundai||santafe||,12,Mustangman,Yes… 12.75 is far too low and will not charge the battery.

I went to install new spark plugs the other day and there was oil in the spark plug wells in both cylinder banks. I know the most common reason for this is bad valve cover gaskets  but I had mine replaced (both) by a reputable shop here in Chicago shortly after I bought the car in January of last year while the engine was out to fix a rear mean seal leak. Is there anything else that might cause this? Thanks for any help you may be able to offer.3

Loose plugs will cause their own problems - misfires usually.If the spark plug well seals on the Audi are as finicky as my old Honda  I’d say that is still the problem.
124690,https://community.cartalk.com/t/audi-a4-3-2-oil-on-spark-plugs/124690,Audi A4 3.2 - Oil on spark plugs,Maintenance/Repairs,||a4||audi||,3,oldtimer_11,When replacing a valve cover or cam cover gasket you should always examine the cover to make sure the bolt holes in the cover and the spark plug well (if equipped) are not distorted. If I discover a dimple  I reverse it slightly with a small ball peen hammer. Then don’t overtorque the fasteners.This is why you can sometimes do a better job that a mechanic working at a shop that cares more about speed than anything else.I did a brake job on a friends car that had previously been done at the Ford dealer. After the dealership did them  the rear brakes continually needed adjustment. After several years of putting up with this  he complained to me and I offered to do the rear brakes.When I dook the drums off I discovered they had put two right side adjusters on the car. I can only imagine this happening if they didn’t want to wait for the right part.

It was suggested to me elsewhere that the valve covers themselves might be warped (since they’re plastic and 12 years old). I hope it’s that and not the spark plug tube seals  since it’s a ridiculously involved job to get to those in this engine.

Also says the transaxle mount is filled with oil compared to the other engine mounts?The thing is I don’t see anything online for a transaxle mount. I’ve never heard of It and NOTHING comes up onlineSo I guess my question is is he confusing a transaxle mount for a transmission mount?

If the seat came out of a car that was rear ended in a collision and the seat was occupied that is likely how the seat was damaged.

It’s not like you need the seat to have 100% structural integrity in something that never moves.

Read the service schedule in your manual and see what a trusted mechanic would do for you . I would also suspect that there is other service that is needed on this very expensive vehicle.In your previous thread you said you were a doctor . As my primary doctor says that some times sending a patient to a specialist is a good idea. Therefore I recommend you send your patient ( this Mercedes ) to a specialist .

But I am very against switching to full synthetic on a well used engine. What can happen is that any carbon build up created on rings and bore can actually help seal. When you switch to synthetic it tends to clean some of the carbon. It also lubricates so well that seal is lost between rings and bore. The best application for synthetic is on new car just after break in. If you don’t break it in first the rings don’t seat to the bore due to excess lubrication.

Any good filter is fine. Plan on half the distance for your normal oil change for the NEXT change after using synthetic. Also check you oil level every fill-up of gas.Why? Synthetic may flush a bunch of the junk out of your engine and it will tend to use twice as much or more as you would see with regular oil. Top up as needed. If you normally change at 5000 miles  do it as 2500 miles and then the next change would be 5000. Keep checking oil levels often. As things settle down the consumption should go back to whatever is normal for this car. If it doesn’t  go back to regular oil but I’ve never had to do that.

It may say 6000 miles or 6 months so why would you argue with that.Edit: using a basis of 100 000 miles at 6500 miles that is 15 oils changes - at 7500 miles that is 13 oil changes . Not a large amount of money . Either way you will still change at the same time interval so all this is not a big deal.

Julian  I’d love to believe Subaru has fixed its engines  but just this month it settled yet another engine failure lawsuit  this one for the turbocharged engines. Owners are STILL reporting oil consumption failures on Foresters. If it makes you feel any better  oil changes are a tiny fraction of the cost of ownership of a vehicle 3. Here’s some info on that from our partner site.

A 2017 Forester has to be one of the easiest vehicles to do an oil change on.

The leaking seal is letting fluid into the area covered by the boot. The bellows is there to protect the ends of the rack and allow for L and R movement  but is not designed to seal the pressure inside the rack. If the leak sealing fluid doesn’t take care of the problem  then a repaired or rebuilt or new R&P is called for. Or a messy floor and the need to refill the reservoir often will continue.Note: Honda and Acura PS fluid is different from the usual and should be used always.

When the steering is turned to the limit stop  that flexes that joint  and over time the rubber hose can slightly separate from it’s metal connector.

If you have somebody turn the steering wheel all the way to the limit w/the engine idling while you look at the hoses in that area  the one that is flexing the most is the high pressure hose. Look at the connections on both ends for leaks.

You may have a problem with a simple adjustment of the switch. It can be moved in its bracket to adjust it to turn on at the proper time. Try that first.Also  have you had problems with you brakes? Problems that cause the brake pedal to be lower than normal?

Might provide a clue. You may have a short circuit somewhere between the brake light switch and the brake lights. From what I see your brake light switch is just a simple momentary push switch  and should be easy enough to test with an ohm meter. When the brake pedal is depressed  should measure low ohms. Brake pedal released  high ohms. On the 2-pin non-cruise control version  that ohms test is pretty much bullet proof  but the version with the cruise control there are four pins and it is more likely that test was performed incorrectly. My guess is a faulty or incorrectly adjusted brake light switch.
123870,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2002-toyota-corolla-electrical-issues/123870,2002 Toyota Corolla - Electrical issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||toyota||,9,Cougar,From what you said about the problem I assume that the brake lights remain ON even when the car is parked and ignition is OFF. To absolutely prove that the brake switch isn’t causing the issue simply disconnect the wiring to the switch. If the lights only are on when the ignition is ON then this means that the power is getting bridged to the brake light circuit after the ignition switch power. Power to the brake light circuit normally is always HOT to the brake switch so they turn on when the pedal is pushed  even while the ignition is OFF. If the lights turn on when the ignition is ON you can start pulling fuses in the dash panel to see which fused circuit will kill the lights and determine which circuit is causing the trouble. One thing you might try doing is cycling the emergency switch and the turn signals to see if they make a change to the issue. Both are tied to the brake lights circuit. Another hint is if the middle brake light isn’t turning on while this problem is happening  then the emergency light and turn signal circuits are really suspected for the trouble.

I own one and that is really the only thing I miss. It is a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage. I would assume base models of the Nissan Versa may be the same.I have looked into adding it and it isn’t hard at all. You basically buy the controls new or from a salvaged vehicle of a higher trim level with cruise and it is pretty plug and play to install. Apparently the base model is made with all the wiring and computers to run the cruise control but excludes the controls.

Sometimes it will “fix itself” and cool air will return to the driver’s side vents. It is intermittent  some days it doesn’t happen. My dealer can’t figure it out.6

It is likely that the oil changes weren’t taken care of when they should have been for it to be this bad. Modern engines will go a LONG TIME before needing this type of work.If you want to go to 5W40  I suggest the Rotella T6 full synthetic. This is an exceptional oil. I run it in all of my outdoor power equipment which I run quite hard. A couple of my riding mowers put up with abuse that nothing else would. I run them wide open (governor bypassed) cutting what are essentially hay fields for hours on end. I change the oil and filter once a year and the oil doesn’t appear dirty or broken down. These engines also came to me as slight oil burners with nasty lifter ticks (they are Kohler Commands with hydraulic lifters) and now I can’t see any drop on the stick between changes and the lifters sound normal.Going up to a 40W might help with the pressure at operating temps. You might consider a 10W40 if that doesn’t work. I would say you might try a 15W50 if that doesn’t work but then you might start introducing other problems. Again  this engine is probably on its last legs. You are only prolonging its life a little.The 0W40 Mobil 1 European is also a great oil but it tends to be more like a 5W30  so on the thin end of the range. This oil was mainly done so that anti-wear additives could be included for European cars and not to create a new weight. These anti-wear additives have been removed from most US oils as they tend to foul emissions systems over time.

Going from 5w30 to 10w-40 means two “moves”: 5 to 10 at cold temps and 30 to 40 at operating temps. Going to 5w40 means only the second “move”. Going to 0w40 would again be two “moves”.And to be fair  5w40 is a ‘fully synthetic’ oil  so if your car has never used fully synthetic before  that can also be one “move”. (Although there are pages and pages of internet words about whether switching between fully syn  semi-syn  and mineral oil makes a difference)Last  I’m pretty sure there are cars out there with 5w40 as either an optional or recommended weight to use. Mobil and Castrol both make it.

Unless the engine has been neglected it shouldn’t need two rebuilds in 235 000 miles.

The number before W is the thickness of oil when it cold it will operate like 10 or 5 weight in your example. Once the engine is up to operating tempature it will run at 30 weight. It is important to follow your owners book. It will usally tell you what is the heaviest weight you can run. It is also important that you are using full synthetic oil and stay with that. Do not mix a oils ie 2qt this and 1qt that your not a mixing a cosmo for your car or truck lol. With over 200k miles you can use a high mileage oil. If you do go this route it’s fine but you must continue using high mileage oil you can not switch back after you start using it!! The reason for this is they put special additives in these oils to make your valve seals and rings and such expand. So that it forms a better seal for these parts. If you stop using it they will shrink back down and then you will burn oil and or start having oil leaks. My sugestion for you would be if your in a really cold envorment with winters and such go with a 5w or even 0w. Check your book and see what is the correct weight for your case and use it. I live in the desert so my car has in it now a 0w20. When my next oil change comes up I will have them put a 5w30 in it for better protection and better and stable oil pressure.

Desert or Alaska. Use what the manual says to use. I am going to change to 5-30 next time even though manual says use 0-20? It’s your car. If your car is spec’d for 20w  it will produce XX oil pressure. If you use 30w  it will produce higher pressure. Which means lower oil flow. Not what engineers intended

You would see if you re read the post one point I made was to make sure you follow your book for your vehicle. I have no use for 0w20 in my car in the hight temps I live in  rather I need higher protection from wear than protection from cold. The reason they put 0w20 in is for cold start protection and fuel economy. It says so right in my book. It also say I can go up to a 40 race oil if I did that. My car is a real high compression and high rev. I rather have a little more protection and stablize my oil pressure than one more mpg. Once your engine and oil is at operating temp you will lose protection and stable pressure if the engine is put under load ie towing  high rev or race conditions. It’s important to follow your book for both conditions and driving styles. The OP is looking to change the weight or go to a high mileage oil. For that with the mileage he gave us he needs to follow his book for the correct weight/conditions/driving style for his application. But it is vary important that if he dose go over to a High mileage oil he stays with it as I mentioned in my other post. Your close it you go to a higher weight during load conditions your will have more protection from wear it will also help with stable pressures. In the conditions a lighter oil will flow easier and faster(at low temps at non load conditions) that is why you have a lower weight during cold weather and start up so you do not suffer wear. You will lose protection under load and above standard engine and oil temps from lighter oil. This is why an oil cooler will help to mantain pressure and protection because it keeps the oil at optimum tempature so it will flow properly for the weight. Thinner oil will drop pressure at higher temps and protection.

If SAE 0W-20 is not available  SAE 5W-20 oil may be used. However  it must be replaced with SAE 0W-20 at the next oil change.”It seems that Toyota/Subaru is pretty explicit in what oil they recommend. I don’t doubt it’s mainly for CAFE numbers. But straight 40 weight? Nope.

I have friends and family that works for subi/toyota in USA and japan. I got the OM right from Subaru in Japanese. You will find as I did the only reason both Toyota and Subaru have the same thing in the printed OM in au na sa eu for the twins. 0w20 is for the whole fuel economy and cold start. Yea it is cafe numbers. You will find that almost all new Toyota including trucks  camery  im  they are all using 0w20 in most of there cars for cafe#. Subaru engineered it up to 5w40 weight professional race oil.

They do list 20W-50 oil as an option in cars sold here. That isn’t because it’s a good idea  but because everyone here is convinced anything lighter will instantly destroy your motor. So  to sell cars they have to let them think it is an option.Several years ago  I wanted a quart of 10W-30 oil to carry in the car  just in case. I walked into an automotive store downtown and when I asked for 10W-30  this smart aleck punk snarled at me  “It will destroy your motor.”My car at that time had close to 200 000 miles with 10W-30  and as you all know  was not destroyed. But  they all believe it  so much so that many stores only stock 20W-50. Once even Autozone had nothing else.A doctor once tried to tell me this was because the car companies made motors and the bad ones are sold in Mexico  while the good ones go to the USA. More likely  they sell the same motors and the 20W-50 oil moves them to the bad class.

For example the E46 M3’s spec’d a 10W-60 oil. The 2012/2013 Mustang Boss 302 spec’d a 5W-50 weight oil. Weirdly  the Track Pack equipped 2012-2013 Mustang GT also specified 5W-50 while the cars without the Track Pack specified the typical 5W-20. The strange thing is that there are no differences in the engine with track pack cars vs. the non-track pack cars.

Notice that the extreme performance cars vs milder versions of the same cars vary more in the second number than the first. That is because the first number is the base oil and te second number is achieved with viscosity index improvers.Contrary to popular belief even a 0w40 oil does not thicken as it warms  it just thins less. in other words a 40 weight oil is thinner at operating temps than a 0 weight oil that is cold. That is why the first number is the more important one for VVT.

The engine computer is usually pretty good at noticing misfires. It may be you have a misfire code pending  so good idea to check for that. Sometimes the CEL wont turn on until misfires are detected on subsequent drive cycles. What makes you think you have a misfire? Does the engine seem to sputter  slowing down or losing power briefly? Or do you hear something different? If so  under what conditions? If during acceleration or going up steep hills  what you may be noticing is pinging rather than misfiring. Another problem that can cause misfire like symptom is a failing fuel pump. A shop can rig up a fuel pressure gauge so it can be read as you drive. If it falls rapidly at the same time you notice the symptom  you know there’s a fuel pressure problem and likely a failing fuel pump.

[ I’m trying to do a transmission swap. ] You don’t have to remove the engine to replace the transmission. An engine support is used to support the engine/transaxle assembly in the car. Attach the engine support  remove the sub frame leaving the engine/transaxle in the car then remove the transaxle from the engine.The labor time for this is 5.1 hours  you might consider having a transmission shop do this for you.

Take it to the best tranny shop in town and ask them to do an inspection  check for diagnostic codes etc. There’s a possibility it just a solenoid or something repairable  not requiring a replacement transmission. There’s a service bulletin for a failed forward-sprag ass’y for example. The symptom for that is no movement in D or 3  but works in 1 2 and R. A new spag-ass’y design part is available from GM.

Look carefully at the engine. It should not have a carburetor. The 454 was equipped with a 2 barrel throttle body fuel injection.If it drives OK and you are thinking about buying it  have your mechanic look it over and tell you if he thinks it is factory or a Franken-truck cobbled together from parts. The truck IS 25 years old  so look carefully!

I’d rather install a manual rack than have to replace both the pump and the rack ($125 for a manual rack beats $50 for a new pump + $140-$170 for a PS rack and pinion).I should have probably mentioned this car has about 290 000 miles on it and the original steering system.

A bud has had a leak in PS fluid for a couple of years  came down to serpentine belt not moving  has to replace a cover  some lines etc. to the tune of $900.

I couldn’t find the thread where I first mentioned it  but ever since I got the head gasket done  the car was weak idling at startup when it sat for more than 8-10 hours. It would drive like it wasn’t getting fuel or spark  I’d pull over and sit  and the idle would dip down  rise up  and then normalize and everything would be fine until the next time I started the car.My mother recently had a partial hip replacement  so I brought her to my house for three weeks of recuperation. For the four weeks between the surgery (plus one week in the hospital and rehab)  my car basically sat for a month not being driven. I had a solar trickle charger hooked up  so the battery was fine.When I went to start the car up after a month of sitting  it wouldn’t start. It would crank and crank  but in order to get it to start  I had to give it gas by pressing on the gas pedal. After that  it started fine  but the idle would constantly surge up and down. It drove fine under load  but idling was up and down when sitting still.I dropped it off at my favorite shop yesterday  and while they were diagnosing the problem  I had them check the power steering leak. I decided that if it was just the PS pump  like I suspected  I’d let them fix it. It turns out both the rack and the PS pump are leaking  so I’m going to go with @Rod_Knox’s recommendation to convert to manual steering when the leaks get worse. In the meantime  I’m going to keep topping off the PS fluid.It turns out the idling problem was caused by a faulty idle air control valve.@Rod_Knox  you asked me to post the results when I follow your instructions. I’m not ready to do it yet  but I’m getting close. I’ll keep you posted.The good news is the reason getting the car running right is so important is that I have a job interview 100 miles away from home on Monday  and I want to make sure I make it there on time. If I get the job  I can easily afford a new car. Now that I have the summer off from graduate school  and one class to go before I get my master’s degree  I’m focusing on advancing my career and going to a lot of job interviews  so I need my car to get me there. She’s less than 7 000 miles away from my 300 000 mile goal. That’s how long I’ve always planned to keep this car.

Strangely  the power steering fluid leak has slowed down  and it happened when I started driving the car 1 100 miles a week about a month ago. I can’t believe at this mileage I’m still getting almost 35 MPG. Eat your heart out  @EllyEllis!I’m thinking of ordering some PS fluid for Hondas with stop leak in it. In the local stores I can find PS fluid with stop leak  and I can find PS fluid for Hondas  but I can’t find both in the same bottle. Amazon carries it though  and I’m thinking of ordering it.Well  at the 300 000 mile mark  a lot of maintenance is due  so I’m going to be busy this weekend changing all the fluids except the PS fluid. I want to get my money out of the last timing belt job I paid for  and the next one won’t be due until 360 000 miles.(BTW  unlike the picture I took at 200 000 miles  I remembered to turn the engine off to take the picture so the CEL wouldn’t be in the pic again.)

The ECM only displays p0700  but the freeze frame data will display the actual transmission diagnostic codes. That’s the info you need to determine what’s wrong. This code doesn’t usually imply a problem w/the TCM. The p0716 indicates a problem with the transmission’s input speed sensor. It’s a gadget that monitors something going around in a circle to determine how fast it is rotating  using a stationary magnetic pickup and a rotating reluctor wheel. A reluctor wheel has a magnetic pattern on it that the pickup senses as it rotates by. That info is used by the TCM to decide what gear to use  what the hydraulic pressures should be  etc. So if it fails it probably affects the ability of the ECM to control the emissions. That’s probably what is causing the p0700 to appear  and is what to focus on. As mentioned above  check the harness and connectors for that sensor. If nothing found there  remove the sensor and check the reluctor wheel. Still nothing? Replace the sensor  you may get lucky.

I bet 99 in 100 working mechanics couldn’t break down the process  and I’m betting 1 in 4 would misdiagnose or go off the OBDII reading and just say “replace the TCM and Speed Sensor  $500 please!” I will have to pay for the labor since I dont own ramps and I’ve never touched a Tranny (I think the speed sensor is in the bell-housing and beyond my skillset anyway). Do you suggest paying to install a new speed sensor and following up from that point? My place allows me to provide parts  do you know if mine has one or two? Thanks for taking me through the process and for chasing the least costly likely culprit. I can show you the actual scan if you like? Tommy

George sees the same thing you do  he thinks the code is throwing fault codes and I should begin with the speed sensor and go from there. If it’s a ground or loose harness etc  I’ll have to trust the mechanic since I can’t access the bell-housing area to see if something is loose. I wonder what the boot is that plugs into the intake manifold cover that I found free-swinging? George thinks it’s also emissions related and that “boot” is an emissions line for sure. Tommy

Do you suggest paying to install a new speed sensor and following up from that point? My place allows me to provide parts  do you know if mine has one or two? ] It takes a pro-mechanic 4.3 hours to replace the input speed sensor. The transmission’s valve body must be removed to access the sensor apparently. Definitely not a diy’er job  at least for a diy’er who mainly just does their own oil changes. So it would probably be worth it to invest in some pro-diagnostic time to make sure the problem is the sensor or tone wheel vs the wiring harness that services the sensor. If I had that problem and nothing visually obvious was wrong  the way I’d address it is ask my regular shop who’s the best transmission specialty shop in town  and go there ask them to fix it. And I wouldn’t buy the replacement parts myself  I’d let the transmission shop choose the parts. That’s so if the replacement parts fail or is the wrong version  it is their problem  not yours.You might find the following link interesting.https://www.obd-codes.com/p0716 1

My very trusted regular mechanic (also a friend) told me to start by replacing the tranny filter because it was acting like it was low on fluid (or fluid wasnt getting through). He found it was 1 quart low  but he didn’t have a tool needed to get to my filter. I took it to a popular tranny shop not half a mile away  the owner offered to swing by my mechanic and drive my car to his shop (for a filter change? Awfully nice of him right?). I went to his shop at 8:30 am and his guy hadn’t popped my hood yet (they had just opened)  he called me at 8:52 to tell me my tranny was shot  22 minutes later! My mechanic spends that much running a complete OBDII scan and this guy dubbed my tranny as toast in 22 minutes or less? He said “your fluid is almost black” and that was the sole determining factor. My mechanic added a quart of fluid and it drove fine for him in drive  it only slipped in reverse… I plan on having my car towed elsewhere in the am. I meant to tell you he informed me the entire tranny had to be pulled to change my filter? The GMC dealer quoted me $199 to change my filter  but they charge $1 050 to replace the input speed sensor ($985 is labor for pulling the tranny)  this means the tranny doesn’t have to be dropped to change my filter  so my new tranny shop pal lied to me.

My regular mechanic will run extensive diagnostics that take about 30 min  and doesn’t include the time he spends on physical inspections. I think the tranny shop is the biggest snake oil salesman I’ve ever met. I should have been suspicious when the owner offered to go to my mechanic to pick up my car from my mechanic and drive it to his shop when I was only asking for a tranny filter replacement (not much profit in a filter replacement). My mechanic didnt have the tool to get to my tranny filter. The car drove fine for my mechanic in drive  it was only in reverse that it slipped. I cant say 100%  but this sounds like electrical issues  not a rebuild…I’d like to hear from you please before i take it elsewhere tomorrow.

I see the tranny has to be dropped to replace the input speed sensor  so now it’s left to find if it’s the sensor itself  a broken wire/ground or something else before dropping $1000 to replace that sensor. The tranny shop is saying rebuild  they had my car for 22 minutes before making that determination  as you can imagine I’m getting some bad info from someone. I hate not knowing anything about this and being left at the mercy of someone else’s ridiculously fast assessment.

The conventional automatics are the 6T30/40/50 line  or the 6T70/75 line. If you have one from the first set  from what I see the transmission doesn’t need to be removed to service the input speed sensor; however  the valve body has to be removed  and access to that requires the front transmission mount be removed. The shop might find it easier in the long run to just remove the transmission  thinking once they remove the valve body they’ll probably find something else in need or repair. I don’t see a procedure to replace the transmission filter  but the parts cost is over $500  so it probably isn’t designed to be replaced except during a major service or rebuild. The filter seems to be located inside the torque converter/fluid pump housing; i.e. probably not a simple thing to replace. (For comparison  it takes about 5 minutes to replace the trans filter once the pan is removed on my truck.)

Please help asap,Maintenance/Repairs,||terrain||gmc||,45,wyattspoppa,I’ll do that in the AM George  they actually had it open and installed the Input speed sensor I picked up at Napa (I got the right OEM part!). I want to be frank with you  my mechanics are both capable men and I’ve used them for years  but they seem to work just on tons of hands-on experience and not guys who study shop manuals which is partly why I sought your expertise. The good news is we made the right call  this wasn’t mechanical  which saved me a $3000+ rebuild I just couldn’t afford with my wife’s surgery Monday  my concern is after following your notes and dozens of hours of my own study  what can they miss before they close up the Tranny case? Can they still run OBD codes before they zip it up? They are people I call friends and they’re very generous with me  but dropping the tranny costs labor hours they have to account for at “Tuneup Masters”  if something is missed  it’s not like I can expect them to drop it again “gratis”. This will be about whether the work gets the tranny and it’s sensors playing nicely with the PCM  if they miss something…bad news for me. I do know their scanner is a $5 000 “heavy hitter” so it should be able to diagnose and reset  but I’d greatly appreciate any thoughts you’d have on the matter before I let them put it back George. Oh  and I got misinformation from the dealer  they told me $199 to “service” the filter  they charge $500 so it’s the one you said  it couldn’t be accessed easily. What advice would you give before “stitching it back up”? Inspect wiring harnesses I assume  running the scan (if possible while it’s open)  replacing the filter and fluid (if the filter isn’t some special $500 component). Thank you for every moment of your valuable time  this kept my family from more trouble than I can say.

Teenagers kept trying to engage me in drag races at stop lights b/c of all the exhaust noise my truck was making .It sounds like you got the transmission input speed sensor problem solved. Good for you. If I had that problem at this point I’d just ask them to do what you suggest above: check the wiring harness to make sure everything connected properly  drive it for a week or so then bring it back to double check for any remaining engine and transmission diagnostics codes. Refill with fresh fluid of course. Absent any symptom definitely related to the filter  I wouldn’t mess w/the filter.

While they had it open  my mechanic went ahead and put in the new OEM input speed sensor I bought anyway  why risk it if it might be bad  right?

Why? ] The fuel gauge sender unit is a float like contraption located inside the fuel tank  and there’s a wire from it to the fuel gauge. Probably that wire had disconnected itself for some reason  and the exhaust guy noticed it and reconnected. The fellow who sold me my truck (used  one year old) told me the fuel gauge for one of the tanks hadn’t worked in the entire year he owned the truck. I took a quick look and the wire had become disconnected under the dash. Stuff like that happens. As far as improved mpg with the improved exhaust system  might be the exhaust leak was affecting the o2 sensor reading. The computer uses that to set the fuel to air mixture. Modern electronic fuel injected engines rarely run well if there’s a leak in the exhaust system.Wishing you best of luck with your wife’s medical problem and your vehicles.

If no power is getting to that fuse then check the fuse labled INT/BAT in the panel under the hood. If power is good there but not to fuse 19 then the trouble is most likely at splice connection S223. The door locks are tied to that splice also.

I have a 2012 Outback with 140k miles on it. I’ve had the check engine light and traction control light on with the cruise control light and red brake light flashing for months. I took it in to the dealer  who said I need a new catalytic converter. I’ve had the brakes and rotors replaced since this started  no brake issues since. Lights seem to respond to significant temperature changes  but will also turn on after driving for ~15 mins if the car starts with them off initially. Today  failed state inspection because of the brake light flashing. Do I really need a catalytic converter? Incidentally  a coworker had a similar issue and said it ended up being the ignition coil pack. Thoughts? Thank you!3

To offer much help here we need to know what those code numbers are. They usually start with the letter “P”. It sounds like you have more than one problem.

When the warning lights are on shut the engine off and remove the connector with the small wires going to the alternator  don’t mess with the large main output wire on the alternator. Start the engine and see if the warning lights are out. If they go out then chances are the trouble is within the alternator. The battery warning light may turn on while you do this procedure.

I took it in to the dealer  who said I need a new catalytic converter. ] On the newer generation Subarus  when the CEL lights-up  all of the other lights will be activated as well  in order to make sure that you notice that something is amiss. This was done because there is a significant portion of the population that believes it to be “normal” for a CEL to be lit-up  and thus–they think that it can be ignored. [ Do I really need a catalytic converter? ] From afar  nobody can answer that question. [ If the CEL is on  there will be diagnostic codes stored in the computer memory. ] … and  based on what the folks at the dealership told you  it is likely that the codes will indicate a problem with the catalytic converter but without knowing the exact codes  this is just a shot in the dark on my part. However  if the codes indicate a problem with the cat converter  it is entirely possible that simply replacing oxygen sensors will remedy the problem. Again  from afar  nobody can say for sure.I hope the OP is aware that the vehicle’s anti-skid system is currently disabled  along with the Cruise Control  so the vehicle is definitely less-safe to drive until the underlying problem is repaired.

Sometimes I can also hear it after shifting into second but it’s much less pronounced. This only happens right after I start driving and goes away fairly quickly. But  when it does make the noise  especially in first  it is very  very noticeable.The clutch was replaced at a dealer within the last year. It does not sound like pilot bearing  throwout bearing  or input shaft bearing noise at all. It only happens as I’m releasing the clutch - there is no noise if I’m in neutral or once I’m in gear. I’ve also noticed it’s more likely to happen if I’ve just driven in reverse  like after backing down the driveway.I don’t know if this is something to be concerned about

Fuses are all working except slot 7  8  18  19 and 34. Replaces them and the tester still doesn’t light up. Maybe a harness got unplugged but I can’t find anything that got unplugged.

If all those fuses are good then check the connector to that panel and make sure it is making good connection. If all that is good then either the connection between the panels has a problem or there may be a problem with the ignition switch contacts tied to that section of fuses.

A misfire on #3 could be a bad coil  sure  bad plug  bad wire  faulty wire connections TO the coil. It could also be a bad injector for #3 or even a defective engine computer. And it could be that that cylinder has a bigger problem like a burned valve or low compression. [ changed the oil and spark plugs because they were drenched in oil ] Now you tell me this. Plugs drenched in oil (if you mean the electrode was oily wet) tells me the rings are worn out. #3 is worn more than the others so it misfires badly enough to throw a P0303. I’d suggest you run a dry and wet compression test on the engine as I suspect there is a serious problem in #3. Low dry and wet compression points to a burnt valve. Low dry and OK wet compression tells me the rings are at fault. Good Luck.

If you remove the radiator cap (engine cold)  turn the heater control to hot but leave the fan off  and start the engine and let it warm up  look for bubbles emerging at the radiator cap. That’s probably combustion gasses. Head gasket leak.

If the starter solenoid contacts are causing the trouble (indicated by the hammer trick) then they will have to be replaced or just replace the whole starter.
124201,https://community.cartalk.com/t/starter-issues-with-my-dodge/124201,Starter Issues with my dodge,Maintenance/Repairs,||magnum||dodge||,4,George_San_Jose1,Unless you have a manual transmission  probably not possible to get it started at this point until the starter motor is replaced. There is some possibility I guess the problem isn’t the starter motor  but an electrical problem instead. If this is an automatic  try cranking in N rather than P. If a manual  try pumping the clutch pedal a few times before cranking  or try with different amounts of clutch pedal depression  see if that has any effect. If there’s somebody there who knows how to work a volt meter  they could measure the two terminals on the starter motor to see if they both read 10.5 volts or above when the key is in start. If they do  you need a new starter motor.An experienced mechanic might be able to short the solenoid out with a screwdriver to get it to crank  but this isn’t something an amateur should try. Too dangerous. But no harm at this point to try tapping on the starter motor from a different direction  or a harder tap I suppose.

Fluid film 2 seems to be a popular choice that works reasonable well and is transparent for visible spots. But some people are saying crc 4 works better but it isn’t transparent so it would only be good for the undercarriage but its thicker and lasts longer. Then there’re rust converters like this one also by crc 4 What do you think would be the best to deal with existing undercarriage rust and prevent more from forming? If these products live up to their advertising I’m thinking the rust converter followed by a rust preventing coating would be best. What do you think? Has anyone used these products or something else that worked better?10
125020,https://community.cartalk.com/t/best-rust-treatment/125020,Best rust treatment,Maintenance/Repairs,||rust||maxima||nissan||,2,jtsanders,Fluid Film is a wax. Just as you was the paint on your car to protect it  this product would behave the same way underneath. The other two don’t really say how they protect the surface. My favorite rust treatments are a combination of a conversion coating and a paint. The conversion coating  like magnesium phosphate  are a mild acid that remove the remaining rust  then after the acid I see neutralized  coat the surface with the phosphate. The conversion coating is also a great preprint treatment  and after the paint dries  you get an excellent rust preventative. Don’t spray it twice  though. If you want a top coat on this  use a paint without the conversion coating.

He was a frequent  very frequent contributor here and an advocate for rust prevention. Google some of his stuff on this site. Here’s a little sample…dagosa Jan '13 “What do you mean about the rust dagosa?” Most people think rust prevention is either a matter of just keeping the car clean by running through a car wash and/or having someone do a one time rust spray under the body  The second couldn’t be farther from the truth. Google “rust prevention by spraying” inner body panels with motor or linseed oil (for environmentalist) and inspecting drain holes and the insides of the vehicles. The real rust  other then body damage on the outside starts where the welds are from the body panels  inside. You do treatment once every two years. On a small compact it takes ten minutes…less time then a wash jobALL body shop personel I have talked to in Maine (really only four shops) either do it to their own cars and/or others privately or recommend it to their friends. A conversation with some one in a body shop and Googling environmentally friendly options is worthwhile. You can no longer hire professionals to do it as it is not environmentally friendly if you use motor oil. Linseed and other organic oils work as well. Just a little education…I wish I had learned about this in my twenties instead of my thirties. MY CARS  SOME TEN PLUS YEARS OLD HAVE NEVER RUSTED anywhere. I get thousands more come trade in time…over a car with any rust through. The person that showed me this  has cars 30 plus years old with no rust that he still drives in Maine winters…Frame members can be painted with grease etc. as well. You will get dirty but I figure I pay myself $300 an hour in savings. Pretty good part time job  aaya aha. _ A discussion here…_http://www.hotrodders.com/forum/rust-proofing-oil-72414.htmlhttp://www.solventfreepaint.com/info/case_study_OrganicRustproofing.htmBTW  if you do use motor oil and not organic  use fresh not used as others have mentioned and take steps to contain the run off to protect the environment…it is possible to do !Dagosa wrote about this many times for years  swore by it.I hate driving in salt during the winter. I found the perfect treatment for driving in salt and rusting out my car. I apply what is called Endless Summer. Just before the first snowflake every year I will now be joining all the other Snowbirds and heading to the Sun Coast. CSA

When I got it home  I put a new battery on it and grabbed a can of starting fluid for first test  figuring if it was a fuel issue it would fire and if it was an electrical issue then it wouldn’t fire… No spark… So we started at the top  replaced the coil  spark plugs  wires  cap and rotor… still no spark… replaced the crank position sensor  all the relays and fuses  even if they were good  didn’t take any chances… still no spark… noticed the ECM was from a junk yard so we replaced it with a pre-programmed one from O’Reilly’s… still no spark… next we replaced the entire distributor… sadly still no spark… we noticed that the throttle body was missing a couple screws holding sensors on so we decided to take the safe route and totally rebuilt the throttle body including replacing all the sensors on it… Alas we still have no spark  even checked to see if coil was getting power and and according to the volt tester the wires into the coil have no juice at all… So other than a wiring issue  what am I missing?14

Whenever you have an ignition problem the first thing to check  in my book at least  is power to the ignition system. Once that is confirmed then you move on to checking for faulty ignition parts. Hopefully you already made sure no fuses were blown out  especially for the ignition system. If the fuses are all good then you need to trace wires from the fuse panel to the ignition area and see where the problem is at. Make sure the grounding is good also. You would be wise to invest in a factory service manual to guide you through the wiring. Ebay is a good place to purchase one at a good price. You have already spend more money than the cost of a manual on needless parts.Looking at some data it shows fuses 4 and 8 in the distribution panel under the hood are important fuses for the engine operation. Make sure they are good. There is a shut down relay that should have power going to a dark green/orange wire for the PCM.

The PCM intermittently grounds the negative lead of the coil to charge the coil and fire the spark plugs. From what I can tell the power to the primary lead on the coil comes via the auto-shutdown relay  pin 87. That pin also supplies battery power to the injectors  and the o2 sensor’s heaters. So that’s the first place to check. (Applies to the JTEC version  which I presume you have.)

It will make this job pretty simple now to find the problem using them and a meter to make the checks with. Power has to get to the PCM in order to get to the coil. Once that is solved hopefully you be good to go and have no more issues for a while.

In my old flat tappet domestic trucks I use 15W40 synthetic because it seems to offer the best of both worlds in that it is synthetic while it has the additives that flat tappets need and is rated for use well below and above the .local seasonal temperature extremes.I have for years observed that people who pay close attention to climate  oil grades and viscosity usually enjoy a long a relatively trouble free life from their cars regardless which weight they choose. Those are the people who keep up with oil changes and regularly check their oil and among them those who use 0W20 and those who use 10W30 see very little difference in engine life.

I would have suspected 5W30 or 5W20. I don’t know but a lot of Toyotas have gone to pretty thin oil these days.Honestly you just need to get that old oil out of the engine. 11 years even with barely any miles is TOO LONG. With the use of this truck  the oil type probably isn’t a huge deal. It just needs to be changed so that acids and moisture don’t corrode the engine from the inside out. You probably also want to flush the cooling system and do other maintenance as well. I could see the coolant being quite bad in a truck like this.I am going to throw out two that I would suggest.Mobil 1 0W40 European - You can get the 5 quart jugs at Wal-Mart for like $25. This is a great oil for that kind of money. I have always been told this is more like a 5w30 but was branded this way to meet the more stringent European oil standards while keeping in line with US emissions standards.Rotella T6 5W40. This seems a little thick for some modern vehicles if you ask me but if your truck REALLY calls for 15W40  this is a very good oil for the money as well. This is really on the thick side of the 5W40 specs so be careful. I use it in all my outdoor power equipment and have no issues no matter how hot or cold it gets. The newer stuff with hydraulic lifters seems to really like it. The lifters used to clatter and then overpump on some neglected equipment I got. I would then have to wait for the lifters to bleed down so I could restart the equipment. This went away in short order once I changed to this oil.And then I guess I will throw in a third… Whatever conventional oil this truck calls for. If it were to suggest 5W30 or 10W30  use the 5W30. Change it at least every 3 years and made sure you run it long enough to get the engine up to temp for a while.My gut tells me there are all kinds of other things that will need attention as well. The coolant likely needs to be changed and the brake fluid is likely getting moisture in it from sitting as well. There are likely all kinds of little things that need to be done to this truck.

That’s the important thing  not the exact oil weight used.In Cycle Guide their ‘ask a mechanic column’ author said the bikes that ran the longest had the owners that were always asking about maintenance. The bikes that died? Their owners only showed up when there was a problem.

The reason is they designed the engine  determined the bearing clearances  and tested for the correct oil viscosity. There is a thing called hydrodynamic oil pressure/lubrication. If the oil is too thin and the clearances loose  oil film under load is compromised and a bearing might seize. If the oil is too thick and if it is an engine with tight bearing clearances  the oil might not move through fast enough to maintain film and cooling and a bearing might seize. Bottom line  you don’t want to fry/seize a bearing so follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.

How viscous is oil at 50f? Like cold motor? 0-30 is marginally better for cold flow at startup vs 5-30 and 10-30. All perform the same when hot. 0-40 performs the same as 20-40 when hot.

How did the old oil look when it was drained? Also you might try to change this at least every 2-3 years and that is only if your infrequent trips are long enough to get the engine up to temp and keep it there a while. If short  change it once a year or after it is used if you know it will be a year or more before it is used again.Engines like this are going to be much more forgiving to varying oil viscosity than something made today. So many components these days (chain tensioners  valve timing  valve lash  etc.) rely on the oil as a hydraulic fluid as well as a lubricant. Engines are also made a lot tighter these days with a thinner oil spec in mind. This is a good thing for life of the engine and fuel economy but I sure wouldn’t put 20W50 in my car that calls for 0W20.

Additionally 1 of the 2 possible recommendations  20w40  isn’t available anymore. [ How did the old oil look when it was drained? ] About the same as it did new. I have a strong magnet. I put it on the bottom of the draining tub. It didn’t attract anything. At 2 583 miles in a well-maintained engine I expected no different. [ Also you might try to change this at least every 2-3 years ] I won’t. This oil looked okay. My engine sounds the same as always. It has spec compression. It gets NHTSA gas mileage. I pass biennial emissions tests with numbers as low as those required of new cars.

The only real way would be to send a sample off to a lab like Blackstone. They may suggest something that equates to 10-11 years but you never know. Your use of this truck is such an outlier compared to most others so everything that we hear may break down and be meaningless.I would be worried about moisture and acids building up in the oil.

I used to change oil every 3000 miles or once a month when I was on the road  so I would have changed oil about 130 times in the same time span.

I bought my 2017 Honda CR-V in April 2017. 9 days after I bought it  it just stopped working. It wouldn’t start at all. The dealer told me that the whole computer system for the car was faulty and they replaced it. It has been running fine for the 14 months since it was replaced. However  I think it just happened again. The car just stopped working. It has been towed to the dealer and I am waiting to hear what the issue is. My question is: if this is another failed computer  does that qualify as a lemon? My understanding is that if the same serious safety defect occurs twice with 24 months of buying the car  it is a lemon. (I live in Washington  by the way.) Obviously after what I went through last year  I am very concerned. But I can’t find a list anywhere of what problems are considered “serious safety defects.” Any thoughts on the matter are much appreciated. Thanks!10

One is whether the first diagnosis was correct  2nd is we don’t know what the current problem or diagnosis is. I think a 2017 car that decides not to start at random times could be considered a lemon. Safety is a relative thing. The car not starting at certain places around midnight could be a safety issue. I will keep records and if the dealer is not helpful call the regional rep. I also have a bad feeling about this problem being fixed now (which would make you not to be able to file a lemon suit)  only to return when your warranty runs out.

A new mounting bracket with adhesive pad should be installed  the rear fascia/bumper cover must be properly prepped before installing.I don’t think your body shop is good with handling safety systems  ask your insurance company if you can take the vehicle to your dealer to complete the repair.

Any kind of silicone sealant would hold better than that. Choosing one of the better ones would probably hold for years. The right one would probably be perfect. Any body shop could have figured out how to attach that. They just have to make some effort. That picture is perfect. Good thing the exhaust pipe wasn’t on that side or they would have used metal tape and stuck it to that!

I had a co-worker that towed an old car on a trailer with a Dodge Ram 150 equipped with a 225 CID/3.7 liter engine  it was able to tow but one must be patient.Towing capacity has more to do with the cooling systems of the engine  transmission and differentials.

It would start back up  but only keep going if I was on the gas. I ended up freaking out and taking it into a local shop. They told me my PCV valve needed replaced  and that it had a misfire as well as the oil cap wouldn’t even come off when it was running (don’t know if that’s a thing). So I agreed to have it replaced. I went this morning to pick it up  and even though they said it seemed to idle a bit rough at the start it seemed to be OK now. Well it wasn’t I drove one mile to my work and it was idling again all crazy. I turned it off and back on and it had a tough time starting (but did). And the very bizarre thing is my A/C no longer worked and I ended up with a “stability control error”.I promptly ran it back up there and talked to them. They look really baffled  but did mention if a code got flipped in some cars the A/C no longer will run. I have never heard of that before  but I guess if it’s true maybe it relieves load off the engine?Anyhow I am sitting here a bit freaked out as I am broke and I have no idea what they are going to say. So I wanted to ask around and see if the rough idle  starting symptoms line up with a bad PCV valve. And if anyone had heard of the A/C shut down situation…Thanks for the help!15

Unplug that coil and coil 4 (far left coil).Remove the bolt that holds those coils in place. I 'm pretty sure the bolts are 8mm  Swap the two coils by pulling straight up on the coil. Secure the coils with the bolts and plug them back in.Clear the old codes.Start the engine and take it for a short drive.Re-read the new codes. If that coil that WAS in number 2 was bad  you should now get a P030400 code. If you still get a P030200 then it is either a bad spark plug  valve  rings  or maybe just a bad wire somewhere.Yosemite

Whenever the temp drops below about 40 degrees (F) the air-bag warning light in the dash begins to blink: it blinks three times and pauses  then blinks four times and pauses  then it repeats the cycle endlessly UNTIL the outside temp warms up. If the outside temp stays forty or below the blinking never stops! In addition  the passenger airbag OFF light doesn’t light up as long as the blinking continues. (I normally drive solo so I keep the keyed passenger airbag set to OFF). On warm days everything’s fine: no dash light blinking and the passenger airbag OFF light illuminates properly. How can cold temps be causing this problem?1

A 3-blink code  however  indicates a bad power connection.If I had to guess  there’s a wire break or a plug is not seated properly  and when it gets cold the wire contracts enough to break the circuit.

Of course none of this is needed on a commuter car for changing wheels let alone struts.I have witnessed a standard socket shattering under impact driver use. Good thing the guy doing it had on safety glasses. Don’t do that  buy the correct hardened sockets or you may regret it someday…

That way if you do manage to cross-thread something  you’re screwing up the part that comes off quickly  not the part that you have to disassemble the hub to get off. Oftentimes a cross-threaded race car’s lugnut will just split and fall off the stud.In series where pit stop times aren’t as important  they’ll often hand-start the lug nut to make sure they don’t crossthread before they apply the torque gun.

I think she heard me… We limped it home  changed the leaking water pump and gave it another go. Heater hose connectors blew on the next ride  overheated again  replaced those. They were so rotted out that they snapped off in the tensioner pulley so we replaced that too. Still overheated. Obviously the thermostat was bad so let’s replace that sucker and now I’m certain it’ll stop overheating because I’m pretty sure I’m out of bits to fix but the damn thing won’t start for me to find out. I’m not mechanically savvy and honestly i didn’t know half of the words in this paragraph when the whole thing started but I’m learning. There were some vacuum hoses that snapped off in the thermo replacement (seen in the picture) but I (think) i fixed those too… So i don’t know what I’m missing and apparently I’m the only one on the entire internet with this specific problem so I’m open to descriptive suggestions that preferably include pictures. When i took the thermostat out it was literally pitch black and the housing was full of what can only be described as ash and bone dry. The old girl turns and turns and clicks and clicks but just won’t start. I walked to auto zone 4 times today and their laughter as i wandered in repeatedly with random car parts saying “what is this and what does it do?” will haunt my dreams for years to come. The picture is to see if anyone notices anything that should be attached that isn’t.11

You’re not trying to start the engine without the plug wires  are you?

I think she heard me… We limped it home  changed the leaking water pump and gave it another go. ] During the summer months I see cars towed in each week with failed water pumps or leaking radiators the were driven too long while overheating. The result is warped cylinder heads and no compression  a used engine is usually the least expensive remedy.Perform a compression test  at least on the from 3 cylinders.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,6,graybeard47,Reply from Nevada_545 has pretty much said it all. Driving an overheated vehicle other than to pull it off the road immediately  shut it off and keep it off has ruined the engine beyond reasonable out of pocket expense to fix the problem.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,7,Cougar,The condition of the engine doesn’t sound good from what you say about the coolant or lack there of. If you haven’t already checked for spark to the plugs then you need to do that. If you have spark then spray a small amount of starter fluid into the air intake and see if that makes the engine at least a little bit. If that works then you may have a fuel delivery issue or injector power problem. Check the error codes for clues to the problem.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,8,Marisha_Lee,So there’s spark and starter fluid just made it pop and smoke. A neighbor who was a diesel mechanic for heavy equipment suggested it could have something to do with the security system but i haven’t been able to find a definitive way of testing that theory. How do you do a compression test? My father in law is coming up today to give it one more go before i break down and tow it to a shop.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,9,tcmichnorth,Check compression on all cylinders. Symptoms indicate bad head gasket. That allows pressure from pistons to escape into coolant system. Overheating can cause gasket failure and/or head warpage. Otherwise. Spark (at right time)  fuel  air  and compression car will run.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,10,Cougar,Since the starter fluid worked to some degree  the results make me wonder about the ignition timing since it is popping.

How do i check compression? I’m doing my research but insider tips and tricks are always helpful.
124688,https://community.cartalk.com/t/no-start-after-thermostat-replacement/124688,No start after thermostat replacement,Maintenance/Repairs,||buick||parkavenue||,12,tcmichnorth,Start with a healthy fully charged battery. Blow dirt out of each spark plug pocket. Remove all spark plugs and note the difference between each one. Know which cylinder each came from. Put a light film of oil on rubber seal of compression tester. Screw compression tester in spark plug opening less than hand tight. Crank engine for 5 to 7 seconds. Repeat on all cylinders. Compression should be all the same on all cylinders within about 15 lbs. Should all be well over 100 lbs

OK  so  like  I have this 2017 Chevy Volt  and I’m happy with it. Well  pretty much. I mean  like  I had to put gas in the car TWICE LAST YEAR. I took it to the Chevy dealer and they acted like that was some kind of good news! As if! I know that gasoline will age and form like humongous molecular chains and stuff  so when I’m forced to PUT GASOLINE IN MY ELECTRIC CAR I also add fuel stabilizer. So does fuel stabilizer  like  have a half-life like nucular fuel? Do I need to add more over time? 'Cos the car computer now starts running the gasoline engine BECAUSE I HAVEN’T PUT ENOUGH FRESH GAS IN IT! I looked in the manual and couldn’t find how to explain that the fuel is stabilized so QUIT RUNNING THE GASOLINE ENGINE! I really don’t think the car computer is smarter than me  but IT WON’T STOP RUNNING THE GASOLINE ENGINE! I can hardly hear my free 10 days of Sirius XM! And I feel like a TOTAL GEEK going to a GAS STATION with my ELECTRIC CAR! Umm  OK  so I guess my questions come down to 1) how often do I need to put fuel stabilizer in my tank and 2) can I tell the car to STOP RUNNING THE GASOLINE ENGINE??? Thank you for your consideration.6

The computer keeps track of when gas was added last  and it will run the gas engine periodically to make sure the gas doesn’t get stale. If it seems like the gas engine is running excessively  take it back to the dealership and let them take a look at it  as your car is still under warranty

I am not sure but I think it will only go about 50 miles on electric power before the gas engine kicks in.

My reverse lights do not come on when I put my truck in reverse. I got out my multi meter and there was voltage at the switch  so I put a jumper in the connector and the lights lit up. Thinking it was a bad switch so I replaced the switch  still no lights. So the big question is does anyone know what to take apart to find whatever it is that pushes the switch. The truck details are : 1994 GMC K1500 350TBI 5 speed  the reverse light switch is on the drivers side of the transmission. Please help I need to fix this for my state inspection.24

Push the plunger in until the lights go out. Now you know the switch is working.Screw the switch back into the transmission with the shifter in Reverse. Use the multimeter to determine when the continuity breaks. Back the switch out 1 or 2 turns and lock it some way. That should do the trick.

So the switch contacts don’t close and turn on the reverse lights on unless the transmission is put into reverse.Remove the switch and plug it back in. Now push on the ball at the end of the switch to see if the reverse lights come on. If they do  whatever pushes on the switch inside the transmission when put into reverse is no longer there.Tester

I seem to remember that my son fixed his truck by getting the right switch after he bought the wrong one. They sell a switch for the right side and the left side and they will not interchange because of the length. Here are the pics:

Both the old switch and new one are working switches  the problem is that the switch isn’t being hit by whatever is inside the transmission. I’m thinking that to fix that means having someone take it apart and would probably cost about $1500 considering that it would cost me about $500 just in labor to do the clutch. I think I’m going to see if I can rig some other switch to get the lights to work.

Try shining a flashlight into the mounting hole as someone shifts in and out of reverse to try to see what is moving or not moving. At the very least  you can confirm the problem is internal.

Assuming the new switch is known good on the bench  is the same exact geometry as the old one  and the old one at one time worked.hmmm … well  I don’t mind kludges  so a kludge fix is easy to come up with. Install a switch on the dashboard to manually power up the backup lights . Works for me. It’s a 94 after all  some kludges at this age are to be expected. But that might not pass the safety inspection.hmm … well  I think using a flashlight to look into that hole may be the thing to do  maybe you’ll get an idea from that. If you can’t see much using a flashlight  maybe invest a few buck in one of those Harbor Freight Bore-hole cameras. I think some are less than $100  and you’d likely find other uses for it in the years ahead. Like next time changing the spark plugs  figuring out if you accidentally dropped that paperclip you were using to hold the wire out of the way into the spark plug hole or not!Frustrating problem. Other than above  if the state requires this to work the way the manufacturer intended  you may have no choice but to remove the transmission. Before doing so it would be wise to get an assessment from a transmission specialist. Ask you mechanic who he uses for transmission work. The transmission shop may have already figured this one out for you.

The transmission had been rebuilt and the reverse lights were stuck on. My colleague assumed it was the switch. I got under the car and changed the switch which did absolutely no good. He then took it back to the transmission shop. they dropped the pan of the transmission and replaced some part. The job took less than an hour and the transmission did not have to be removed.

Then fabricate a bracket that can be mounted under the boot so that when the shift lever is put into reverse  it causes the switch to come in contact with the bracket  thus closing the switch to turn the reverse lights on.Just make sure the contacts for the switch can meet the demands for the current required for the reverse light circuit.Tester

A bore scope is a pretty good idea for looking into it to see what the real issue is but I can’t see myself being able to fix the problem so the $100 cost is a bit steeper than the external switch idea. I think this switch would work ok its listed from radio shack  the part number is NTE54-402 and I’m attaching an image  I’m good with electronics but not real familiar with the loads involved here  some advice might help.

I use one on my Corolla to switch the “START” signal to the starter  rather than forcing that current (which can exceed 10 amps) through the ignition switch. If the current rating of the switch you’ve selected is in question  or you just wanting something more reliable  you can use the switch to power the relay rather than the lights. And use the relay to power the lights. Then you’ll be set. The relay is only a 30 ohm load  500 mA is the most the switch would have to handle if done this way. Best of luck.

When installing a switch in a circuit  you want to install a switch with an amp rating higher than the circuit amps. This allows the contacts in the switch to handle any in-rush current when the switch contacts close.Tester

I have some that are rated at 5A. That being said  you’re driving at least one lamp  probably two. If it were me  I would use the switch to drive the coil on a relay and wire the contacts of the relay into the reverse light circuit. Then you can be sure it will last a long time.

Headlights are usually 55 watts so even using a switch rated for 5 amps should be no problem without having to add a relay.

It’s been many years since I’ve had to replace a backup light bub  but a type 1156 bulb which is what I remember  is rated at 2.1 amps each at 12.8V. Even allowing for a higher draw at   say  14 volts  there is plenty of margin for a switch rated at 15A.

Just by a seat of the pants estimation of the brightness compared to a home light bulb  I would have guessed an incandescent headlight bulb – like the kind used on my early 90’s Corolla or the sealed beam unit on my 70’s Ford truck – would be more like 150-200 watts (on bright). Maybe it is less watts than you’d seem b/c a headlight beam only goes forward  not backward  so it seems brighter.I know the one I took out of my Corolla  one of the filaments measures 0.5 ohm at room temperature. I know that b/c I use it as a dummy load to test my AA batteries. Power is v^2/ r  right? So P = 144/0.5  or 288 watts. r goes up with temp  so the “on” power would be lower than 288 watts  but 100-150 watts isn’t out of the question is it?

I have a 1996 c1500 4.3l/5 speed (mg5/nv3500). I tested checked turn/bu fuse #16 on drivers side of dash and it was fine. I climbed under the truck and checked the connection at the back up light switch. I then pulled the drivers taillight off and let it hang as I didn’t have anyone to help me. I jumped the two wires with the key in run and I got reverse lights to illuminate. I plugged the switch in and pushed the plunger in and I got lights to light up again. I looked into the switch hole and saw that the part that is meant to push the switch was worn. I didn’t like how far the switch had to be depressed  so I bought a new switch. I then put the new switch in the lathe and took .080 inch off of the shoulder and put it back in and everything works as it should. Sorry so long but I hope this helps someone.

This is my first post so I’m sorry if It’s too long but I don’t have anyone else to ask.It’s a 2000 Deville. Before this the fan wasn’t blowing at all. This all takes place between mid June and now (mid August 2018).I took it to a mechanic for a radiator replacement and they tried to get the AC working again by adding refrigerant. It worked two days and went hot again. Took it back  it needed a new hose and compressor. And more refrigerant.Then it goes back because the air goes down to a trickle. Needs a new fan (it’s 5 in the morning so I might be thinking blower  I’m sorry).Last week I discovered the passenger floor was wet. I had to wait about a week for them to get the drain cleared out. I dried the floor in the meantime.Now the ac runs  it is cold  the power is still there but it’s very loud. The sound revs up if you turn it up. It also makes that noise with ac off and just vent. Mechanic says he can see it Monday.Could those new parts have died that fast or is this happening on purpose? I haven’t had this many bad coincidences with a car before  and I’m not big and bad enough to yell at him  but I don’t know if I’m getting the run around. I can’t afford this anymore.

I talked to him and he said it was new. I hope the part can be replaced without having to buy it again or else I might have to go without until a later time. This is the south so it’s miserably humid. Ugh.Thank you for the replies. I’ll see what I can figure out.

The new blower motor came with a blower wheel installed  and it was out of balance. Because of it being out of balance  it was super loud at full speed. I took it back off  took it back  and got a different one under warranty. All better now.Sounds like this is your issue  too. If so  it shouldn’t cost you any more money to fix this. Your mechanic should replace the blower he bought and installed for free.

Their business model is - Move them in and out fast to maximize profit. Google the name of the national chain and count the number of complaints. There’s a reason your local mechanic get’s good reviews.

This happens regularly enough that places like that should always be avoided.

Often these specials are to get you in then tell you that you need a new or rebuilt transmission. Just spread your maintenance items over several months. Ask you regular mechanic the order he thinks. The brake fluid  if the pedal is firm and not ‘mushy’ could probably be put off until you need a complete brake job which could run $500 to over a $1000.

I also replace my own air filters and windshield wipers… easy enough to do on your own).They say it’s been 60 000 since the coolant and transmission fluids were flushed.I can’t remember if the Power Steering and the Brake fluids were ever flushed since I owned it. Possibly yes on the Power Steering fluid. I just don’t remember.The other thing is the oil. I’m 3 000 miles into my last oil change. Of that 3k  about 1 700 are highway miles. The upcoming trip is about 3 600 miles. Get the oil changed now or when I come back? My mechanic wants it changed every 3k… but if I remember correctly  think Tom & Ray have said 5k to 7.5k is okay… but my memory could be faulty on that.

It says oil change at 7.5k  Brake fluid at 80k intervals Transfer case oil at 50k coolant at 30k spark plugs at 60ksevere driving conditions changes all that.

I’ll double check.I always assumed that my regular mechanic had access to all the recommended service intervals on their computer… that’s why I’ve never questioned it. I know that “traditionally” 3k was considered “normal” for oil changes  but in more recent years I’ve been hearing 7 500… but just not sure if 7 500 is a good idea or not. Having said that  it’s $50 to get the oil changed at my mechanic… jes’ sayin’…Not sure if the transfer case oil has been changed  but it seems to me if it needed it  my mechanic would’ve said something about it. They’re pretty good with stuff like that.I did have a tune up and also did the engine service (they clean out all the gunk and stuff) so I know the spark plugs have been changed.

Of all the other fluid changes I’d prioritize the transmission: it’s protecting the second most expensive part of the vehicle. Look at the coolant (engine cold!). Is it clear or cloudy? If clear it can wait awhile. Look at the brake and power steering fluids. Clear or dark? Those chain shops can do more than physically botch a job. They can use some “universal” fluids that are not fully compatible  causing grief down the road.

121106,https://community.cartalk.com/t/it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-mechanic/121106,It feels like I’m cheating on my mechanic,Maintenance/Repairs,||sx4||suzuki||,13,Yosemite,As others have said…those chain shops use fluids that may not be compatible with what your car needs. They will tell you that they add a modifier so that their fluid matches what your cars manufacture calls for  but this modifier does not always match and you could have problems down the road or the entire time your transmission slowly wears out prematurely. Before your trip; I would have the oil changed and the transmission fluid changed. I would also do the brake fluid change  because this is a critical safety issue.Unless the coolant is filthy  I think you could wait with that along with the power steering until you are back from your trip and have saved the money up.Yosemite

That is long gone.I just got an estimate to replace a kitchen sinck and faucet I supply the sink  (Hard to get color) and the faucet  plus new strainers and supply lines. No need to fight an old corroded faucet  leave the old one on the old sink. The plumber had a beautiful new truck. His quotation was $931. No  I do not live in NYC. His boss called 3 days later and said the price was too high. He wanted to send another guy out to re estimate. No wonder their prices are high; 2 free estimates to replace a sink. New estimate $650. No sale. I have a service contract for my AC. Every six months they check the system  clean the drain line  and replace the filters. One is 12 feet up. Tech tests capacitor on outside untit and says its up against the upper limit and asks if I can change it myself. His price from the computer is $169. Part is $19 when I buy only one  and 10 minutes of my labor. I don’t mind paying $100 per hour for a skilled tech and a truck.

When we re-did the kitchen last summer  the new sink was a little lower. I knew I was going to have a problem making the tight connections so bought some parts for $30 at Menards. Two trips to the hardware store for another $25 in parts and no way could I make the connection-off by about an inch. So stopped by the plumbers for my third trip. He came out the next morning  re-did the drains to the wall  and after he made two trips back to the shop for parts  had it done in a couple hours. I got the bill and it was $134. I’ve got a whole box of parts though if I ever need them.I drove to the plumbers and the hardware store.

The main reason I haven’t done them now or don’t do them is that where I live  we don’t have proper “storm drainage” (like they do in the midwest where I grew up). At least in the midwest  you could “believe” that the waste coolant would go down the storm drain and eventually work its way to a waste-water treatment plant somewhere… here… it would essentially go into the soil and/or eventually the ground water… so… yeah. I hear you though!

The storm drains are supposed to get only groundwater and rainwater runoff. Only the sanitary (wastewater) drains go to the wastewater treatment plant. That is why no automotive chemicals should be spilled on the ground.

Many times there is restricted flow of the sanitary lateral  by tree roots clogs etc  that only become an issue during rain events due to restricted flow. There are also palmer valves that get rusted shut  the intent to prevent sewage from going into the perimeter drains in the event of a backup  I could go on  sorry not car related  but if you own a house you might have a car? My guy said dump the antifreeze down the toilet  the bugs at the treatment plant love it  but never down a storm drain.

Any such connection in an old house must be cemented up and every basement must have a sump to collect water and a sump pump to pump it up over the cellar wall and either onto the ground or directly into the storm sewer.

Grounds corrode and cause all kinds of very difficult to diagnose issues.Your Aurora has lots of electronic control units around the car communicating with each other and used to control virtually every function. I’d say your body control module is failing. You will likely will have a hard time finding a replacement. Your Aurora might just be “bricked” or un-fixable. A GM dealer may be your only hope and even that is a long-shot. Good Luck.

If it was my car I’d disconnect and clean both ends of the negative terminal strap on the battery  and maybe even replace it. There is probably corrosion at the connections between wiring and fuse boxes as well and each of those connections might have to be cleaned individually. It’s going to be very tedious and something like this just can not be done by someone you have to pay by the hour because the bill will quickly be much more than the car is worth.

But look for one heavy wire coming into the box on the power side.But it could also be corrosion inside the guts of the fuse panel itself  underneath where the fuse connections are. When I think about  that seems more likely. Specially if it gets wet. And since part of the panel seems to have power.

I’m about to change 3 of the 4 O2 sensors (none are hidden by the exhaust so labor is cheap). It’s now just chasing the electrical problems with my new friends

The fuses for those lights are powered by the lamp control module  the fuses for the lamp control module are in the right rear power distribution center.”Did you check the fuse for the exterior lights with the lights on? If the fuses for the lamp control module are good and there is no power to the fuses in the instrument panel fuse block fuses  consider replacing the lamp control module.

Remove the cover   probably easy to do  and use a dvm to probe the socket to see if you are getting battery power there when it should be on. First by placing the ground probe on the socket case  and try again w/the ground probe connected to a known good chassis ground (bare piece of metal on the car’s body).

I’m not expecting miracles  but maybe a little perspective and ideas on what to pursue.2008 Saturn Vue with 80000 miles on it. It started acting weird right after I had the oil changed and a headlight replaced at a local Jiffy Lube. It wouldn’t start without a jump  so I got a jump start and went to a Western Auto and had a new battery installed. Ran fine for 3 weeks after that.One wintry Friday night after work I turned the key in the ignition switch and instead of turning over  the car was dead.No lights  no warning bing etc. So I called the tow truck and while I was waiting…the dash started blinking and the car radio came back with the default time. I turned the key and the car started up. Drove it to the dealer  told them my issue  they said they would look at it.3 days later: Service manager said they had tried the engine once an hour every hour and it started every time. And they can’t run their diagnostics  etc  until they can reproduce the conditions. So I take it back and it works fine for two weeks.Then in the parking lot of a convenience store  I see a weird “blink” in the dash as I pull the keys from the ignition  and the car goes dead - no flashing light in response to the key fob  etc. BUT…the key is stuck in the ignition and won’t turn  dash panel is blinking and the lights in the driver side door in time with those lights.After about 10 minutes  things seems to “reset”  the dash clock comes back and says it’s 2007 again  and the car starts  Then it runs fine for another 2 weeks And three days ago  it happened again  the same way.It seems as if my best choice is to wait until it happens again and DOESN’T ever 'reset" and then take it to the dealer. But that could happen in an unsafe place or just maybe quit in the middle of traffic or the highway.Is there anything proactive I can do or try? Anything I can suggest to the dealer’s Service Manager? (There’s only one dealer with a Saturn technician in town that I know of  so I am sort of stuck with them).Or should I just start saving for a replacement?Any enlightenment would be appreciated. Again  not looking for miracles  just ideas Thanks in advance.13

I found that after battery replacement  chain-store guys did not bother to clean neither new battery terminals  nor the leads on the wires. Car would start and not start erratically. Upon my check  battery posts had slight dark-lead oxidation  but most importantly  compression fittings on wires had substantial oxidation they did not care to clean at all. I used 600-grit sandpaper on both  then lubricated with petroleum jerry (did not have that “special grease” you can get for $1 in autoparts store)  assembled: started right away and neighbor says it was OK ever since.

BTW  was the battery removed to replace the headlight? Usually the headlight that is on the side of the vehicle where the battery is located is so close to the battery  the battery has to be removed. This could have started the battery problems.
100100,https://community.cartalk.com/t/puzzling-electrical-issue-for-saturn-2008-vue/100100,Puzzling Electrical Issue for Saturn 2008 Vue,Maintenance/Repairs,||electrical-wiring||pontiac||grandprix||,4,Cougar,Bad battery connections are one of the most common issues on vehicles and one of the easiest to fix. If cleaning the battery connections doesn’t correct the issue then there is a pretty simple way to hunt for the problem.Power to the distribution panel under the hood is usually connected from the battery via a smaller wire on the positive battery terminal. There should be a main fuse inside the panel that the wire ties to. That fuse then supplies power to the other fuses inside the panel. Most  if not all of the fuses inside that panel have power on them at all times. Since the memory power is being affected  the trouble is most likely between the battery and that panel. If the wire connection from the battery isn’t causing the problem then suspect the connection to the main fuse itself. If that okay then check the connections going to the other fuses after the main fuse. You might be able to find the trouble by tapping on suspected areas using a screwdriver handle. Having a test light probe to check for power would be good to have for testing connections to see where power is getting to. The smaller ATM type fuses can be checked by placing the probe tip on the slits on top of the fuses. A good fuse that has power getting to it will have power on both sides of the fuse.

In their defense  the chain-store guy had to replace the battery outside the store in the parking lot on a wintry November day  so haste and sloppiness were the order of the day. Thanks!

The replacement headlight from Jiffy-Lube sucks anyway  barely shines at all compared to the original. I have been trying to find a rationale for it causing my engine problems.Thanks for your helpful reply!

They can get burned due to the high current needed by the bulb if there is a resistance at the connection. If it is bad you can purchase a pigtail connector and replace it. The trouble could be somewhere else possibly. You should at least get a test light probe to check the voltage getting to the light. A voltmeter would be even better. The lights are on a different circuit and can’t cause a starting problem. At best  they could just drain the battery so there isn’t enough reserve battery power to run the starter.

Here’s what happened:About six months ago  we noticed that the headlights and radio would flicker—a hardly noticeable dimming while driving. One night  we were running errands and after our last stop  we came back to the car  turned the key and nothing—NOTH - ING. No sounds  no dash lights  remote didn’t do anything  like the battery was gone. We got out and called AAA  and while we waited I would try the remote every couple of minutes to see if it’d do anything. After about 20 minutes  the remote worked  and the car started like nothing was wrong.The next day  I took the car to my local car part store for diagnostics on the electrical system  and they said everything was working properly  and the battery was good but it needed a charge. I put it on a trickle charge overnight  and the car was good for another 2 months.Two months later  same thing. I took the car to my mechanic who I trust  and he said it was the battery. One new battery later  the car was good.Was good for another two months. Last week  same thing. After a full week in the shop  diagnostic test drives  and a thorough going-through  all he could find was bad wheel sensors. We did have a minor issue with the Stabiltrack and traction control dash lights intermittently coming on  but still doesn’t sound to me like it would be the culprit.Something is draining the battery only while it’s running. From a past experience from a rental car  I get the impression cars now have a powersave mode that saves power for… well… I have no idea why. At least with old cars you could tell how much juice was in the battery by how fast the starter cranked.Any insight—from anyone would be greatly appreciated.

The first thing to do is check the battery connections. Make sure the connections are clean and snug tight to the battery posts. If that is okay then you need to check power to the panel under the hood. Check the connections going to the panel for any issues like a loose connector. Power to the ignition switch should come from that panel and then power go to the panel under the dash. It would be good to have at least a test light to see where power is getting to when the problem happens. If things like the dome light and brake lights work the you know that power is getting to the main panel under the hood at least.

Checking integrity of battery cables would be first good step. They may be corroded under the post covers so inspect carefully. Also check chassis and engine grounds. Remove chassis ground and inspect lugs and chassis metal for corrosion.

Yes  the very first thing I did was check the battery connections—cleaned  tightened and greased. The car did it once again last week. My mechanic says he can’t diagnose it until it acts up in his presence  and therein lies the problem; it won’t do it for him. I tried starting the car  letting it idle for about 30 seconds with lights wipers  and air/fan on high—did this about a dozen times in a row to try to max the drain on the system. Still nothing.This is a Florida car  so no cold or salt issues  everything looks like new. Chassis ground is a good suggestion—that’ll be my next attempt but right now  the car is at a body shop because it got rear-ended. Maybe the impact fixed it. ; D I’ll let you know any updates. THANKS AGAIN.

Took it back in to have the ground-to-chassis looked at  but they said it was fine. Battery connections are good. I will check connections in the box on top of the battery and fuses  but this exercise sounds like one of the first things a mechanic would try. The biggest obstacle is that it’s intermittent  and apparently can not be duplicated on demand. So that means the next time it happens—likely at night when my wife is out running errands or shopping in a month or two—I’ll need to go out to the car. But history tells me the car will “come back to life” by the time I get there. Wish I knew how to use a voltage meter.

First  it goes along fine for months not losing oil (we check the oil regularly)  then suddenly the oil goes down quickly. We use synthetic oil. It also goes along fine on antifreeze  bu suddenly loses it and the light comes on. No one can find any leaks. Then  after the front struts were replaced on my 2007 Volvo XC90  there has been a noise that sounds like stretching rubber when you turn the steering wheel. It only occurs on warm days  however. The mechanic where the car is serviced said it may be a leak in the power steering but then couldn’t find one. What’s up with this car?2

123909,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-draining-almost-instantly/123909,Battery draining almost instantly,Maintenance/Repairs,||protege||mazda||,1,ciaranmurphy10_141478,Hey guys So a little backstory. A few weeks ago my Protege (2001 2.0 ES Manual) began giving intermittent starting issues. Every so often when I’d turn the key  I’d hear a click from the engine  but it wouldn’t crank. On the second or third try it would crank and start perfectly as usual. (Note: this has nothing to do with the safety switch on the clutch  since current was reaching the engine and it was a different noise). I stupidly ignored this until one day it failed to start completely.I figured it was a starter issue since I could hear one loud click coming from the starter every time I turned the key. I replaced the starter  but when I put the battery back in  it was dead. I jump started it and it started perfectly. Problem solved  I thought. I drove it for about two hours to try and recharge the battery but when I got home  I switched it off  and when I tried to switch it back on  the battery was already dead. I figured it was either a battery or alternator issue.I took the battery to my local auto parts store to test and charge it  and they said it was a very strong battery. When I brought it home and put it in my car  I started it and switched it off a few times to test it. On the fourth or fifth time in less than a minute  the battery was completely dead.So my question is  does this sound like a bad battery? And if not  what could be completely draining my battery in less than a minute?Thanks!4

As opposed to draining after starting the car a few times.By connections  do you mean battery connections?

123909,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-draining-almost-instantly/123909,Battery draining almost instantly,Maintenance/Repairs,||protege||mazda||,5,Cougar,I suspect that your issue is being caused by internal wire corrosion at the battery clamps. Battery acid can leach into the wire ends and cause enough corrosion issues to make this kind of thing happen. It makes it seem like the battery is discharged but it really has no problem.

Talk to those around you and see if a shop shows up more than a couple of times. Dealers tend to be expensive. National chains can have policies and practices that are not in your best interest. Examples would be upselling or lack of training for the mechanics.

Don’t be fooled by national chain advertised prices. Their bill will be multiples of that price.The problem is that consumers see the cheap price the chains advertise and don’t realize that nobody gets the work done at these chains for less that 3 to 5 times the ad price and they get sloppy work and cheap parts and often additional unnecessary parts.

The rpm’s do not rev up and the car slowly creeps by then eventually will start to get going. I took it in to the mechanic and they told me I need a new throttle body which they just put in. The car worked when I drove it home. Then after a couple of days it is doing the same thing. Anyone have any clue as to what the problem might be? Thanks for the help.22

Did the check engine light come back on after the TB was installed?? Do you know what the code was??

There is a spring on the throttle body that can be reset to put the car back into “normal” mode. However  something else (direct ignition cartridge  crank sensor etc.) is causing a misfire and putting the car into limp home mode. Unfortunately  this means that you probably did not need the new throttle body (ouch!). Classic case of throwing parts at a problem without doing proper diagnostics. I’d go back to the shop and have them look a bit further - and give you a credit for the $900 they charged you for the throttle body :). Good luck!

My car is acting exactly the same way. At first it was the Throttle Sensor  replaced it and was fine for a year. Then the mechanic was saying probably it’s the dirty throttle and he recalibrated the acceleration. Not working. The code then said problem in throttle circuit 1 to circuit 2. My mechanic was saying maybe it’s the wiring…please help…thanks…

First it was the turbo. After changing out the turbo it ran great for 5 miles. Then at take off it was very slow to gain speed until about 20 mph. Code lights suggested mass air flow sensor and evap leak major. IT was suggested to me that I check the mass air flow and then the house between to ensure there are no leaks. He also suggested that the water cooler under the car be removed and cleaned. … Took it to a saab mechanic and he  like many of these guys are simply remove and replace parts until it works…

Which is it? If your Saab is a turbo  this sounds like a turbo-control problem of some sort. If there’s no diagnostic codes then the only other option is to make an educated guess & start replacing stuff sometimes. Either that or live w/it. If I had this problem first thing I’d want is for an experienced SAAB mechanic to make a visual inspection. There may be something obvious that a trained eye would spot quickly.This is a dated thread btw. If you want to get the most replies to your problem here  suggest to repost as a new thread.

A little unclear there  but understand now. So how to you explain that it ran great for 5 miles after a turbo replacement  then the same problem came back? Wouldn’t that argue in favor of a continuing turbo-involved problem of some kind?

On an upward incline  the car slows down until I reach a flat surface again. It is temperamental but when it throws a tantrum  it doesn’t feel safe to drive because it powers down.I thought it might be the turbo but I want to be conservative before I spend $2000 and find out it’s not the turbo . I noticed that when I step on the gas  the hose compresses and it shouldn’t . I wonder if it’s the waste gate??? help!

The intake hose between the turbo and the throttle body? If it does  yeah  that seems like a bad turbo. Remove the hose and reach in a turn the turbo impeller wheel with a finger. It should turn very freely.A wastegate failure would either have tons of power (stuck shut) or none (stuck open) but there wouldn’t be any suction to collapse the intake hose. So  no  I don’t think it is a wastegate.Post back with what you find and maybe we can help some more.

That tube should not collapse. You have a restriction between the air intake and the engine. Pull out the air filter  first and see how clogged it is. If it isn’t  you need to follow the big hose down to the turbocharger and remove the hose for the turbo’s inlet. Spin the impeller with a finger  if it spins freely  I’d guess the intercooler is clogged. If it doesn’t spin freely  you need a new turbo.

The intercooler cools it off first  before allowing it into the engine air intake at the throttle body.

Shop can’t figure it out,Maintenance/Repairs,||airconditioning||,1,Joshtalks,So I have a scion tc 2012 and the A/C no longer works properly. The AC blows lukewarm air (seems to just blow whatever air is outside) when I press the AC button  it doesn’t kick on the compressor. The heat works fine. I took it to a shop and they tested the pressure and said it was good. They can plug in a scan tool and make my car blow cold air but it won’t work without the scantool  the scantool can kick on the compressor. They checked all fuses and relays. They tried replacing A/C amplifier and they tried replacing (A/C switch?). Now they want to charge my $350 to fix drier and evaporater. If that’s not it they want to replace the compressor.This is getting expensive fast  and they haven’t even actually diagnosed the problem!Any ideas what this could be?! Thank youEDIT: Also the radiator fans don’t seem to power on either.28

I’d just turn on the AC switch  and use a voltmeter or test light to trace where the 12 volts from the switch goes away.

If there is continuity in the lock sensor circuit the problem is in the amplifier but not always. Since the A/C amplifier has been replaced the problem may be with the compressor however you mentioned an evaporator repair so I wonder if they found a problem with the evaporator temperature sensor.

I’ve taken it to the shop four times now and it seems it’s just trial and error and I can’t afford to keep buying parts I don’t need. There next ‘step’ was the evaporater and drier  If not  then the compressor. So I am going to take it to a different shop and get a second opinion.

They weren’t charging me after the first two trips then they wanted $350 for another ‘maybe’. So anyways  I took a look at it myself and it’s strange. My AC compressor clutch is engaged  spinning  whether or not my AC is on or off. I tried spinning it myself when the car was off  no budge because it’s stuck engaged. So it’s engaged at all times  and it’s not blowing cold air. I’m beyond confused and more so I don’t understand how it works with the scantool anymore. Sigh.

A/C work is not rocket science  but it takes a specialty shop to quickly diagnose what’s wrong; this shop seems to be guessing.We have a local shop called Auto Temp who do nothing but and also install audio equipment and accessories. They will tell you how far your compressor is worn and what needs to be changed or cleaned out.There are lots of these shops around the country. Dealers often don’t bother training an A/C specialist since newer cars don’t often have A/C problems.

It has a hard time starting when you turn the ignition key (instead of just turning the key for that second it normally takes to turn the engine on…i have to hold the key in the start position until the engine catches and starts)…replaced the crankshaft sensor but no change. it also starts to hesitate (almost hiccup like) slowing down to turn and or stop  coming to a stop  accelerating from a stop. then it just dies. it turns back on. I’ve cleaned the MAF sensor and the throttle body.

You may want to get that fixed also  you may miss an important error code… [ using a steel rod and cleaning the exhaust pipes ] That would be a great way to destroy a perfectly good catalytic converter

Depending on how they do it  it may be very loud  but if the drivability problem goes away at least you know where the problem lies. Ask your shop if it would be a good idea to try that before replacing the cat.My guess however is that this is a fuel pump problem. A shop fuel pressure test is the way to determine one way or the other. It has to be done when the problem is occurring though to be diagnostic. If the fuel pressure is “iffy”  sometimes shops will attach a fuel pressure gauge in a way so they can see it during a test drive. If the hesitation or stall is preceded by a rapid drop in fuel pressure  the cause of problem has been nearly discovered.

A bad O2 sensor will make the car act exactly like the OP describes. Big mystery!Seriously  the code should tell you which O2 sensor. Me  I would replace the sensor. It could be in the wiring or computer but it is most likely just a bad sensor. The few times I have had an O2 sensor code  my gas mileage had dropped before the code appeared and replacing the sensor fixed it.I have never purchased the socket they sell to replace the sensor  since I am not going to put the old on back in I just cut the wire off it and use a deep socket. I use an 18mm spark plug thread chaser to clean the hole and put the new one in with an open end wrench.

I took ur advice and asked about testing the CAT but the mechanic said it cant be done with my make and model because there’s three pieces to the catalytic converter with my 2005 hyundai tucson not like the “average” models with only 2 Cats.

If yes  perhaps you want to consider taking it somewhere else. Once your mechanic decided on a cause and fix  you may have a hard time convincing him/her to look at other causes.I go with the suggestion to replace the upstream sensor before dumping money into a new cat. A relatively easy and inexpensive job.

I presume your shop has done appropriate testing to reach that as the definite conclusion. For the engine to work it has to draw in air and gasoline  burn it  and expel a roughly equivalent amount of exhaust gasses. If the engine is prevented from expelling the exhaust gasses quickly enough  b/c the cat is clogged say  the whole process quickly stalls out. It’s like the old school-boy trick of putting a potato in the teacher’s car’s tailpipe. When the teacher turns the key ready to go home  rrr rrr rrrr   but it won’t start.Mechanics have various methods to test the cat. Measure its temperature  measure the intake manifold vacuum  compare pre-cat and post-cat o2 sensor readings  remove the pre-cat o2 sensor to partially bypass the cat  etc. [ I’m glad i didn’t listen to the guy [who advised] the steel rod ] Another reason to not follow that advice  it’s illegal. Big fines if you ever got caught owning a car with a purposely disabled cat installed.As far as the symptoms  let us know what fixed the problem & how it all turns out. Best of luck.

I have a 2005 Hyundai Tuscon which is what brought me to this conversation. My car would stall out if I was driving 65 MPH or idling in my driveway. No service code! Random  sometimes had trouble restarting but usually restarted right away. My Crankshaft position sensor was bad  (harness to sensor wire coating were melted away exposing wires) that was the original service code. I replaced the Crankshaft Position Sensor. Thought all would be OK but stalling continued. Checked harnesses  seemed OK  looked for melted wires in fuse boxes  all OK. Luckily while idling in my driveway I noticed something new  the cabin blower motor turned on by itself for a few seconds maybe a minute then shut off. Seconds after that the car stalled which sent my attention to to blower motor. I found that the blower motor is attached to something called a Blower Motor Resistor. You don’t need any tools to get to this  it’s located under your glove box  just follow the wire from the blower  it will lead you to it. Disconnect it  very easy (look it up on youtube if your not sure). Solved all my problems  There is a heat sink in this circuit  obviously it produces a lot of heat  my guess over time you can get an arc across circuits that messes with pcm & kills engine. Hope this helps someone that finds this thread

The latter would probably result in a blower fan that only ran on hi speed. So you’d have either off or hi  nothing in between. It’s curious that a blower motor resistor fault could cause the engine to shut off. That resistor does get hot though  and I suppose that heat could adversely affect something else in the ignition or fuel injection system. Or cause inconsistent current loads  arcing  etc on the electrical system and confuse the ecm like you posit above. Good info to know in any event.

With the complexity of today’s electronics most likely the unit would require replacement. You could google services in your area and call around to get an opinion or estimate.

Try dropping the transmission pan and taking a look inside. If it doesn’t look too bad  you might get away with a fluid and filter change. If there lots of trash in the pan  you are in for a rebuild.

Diagnosis: timing cover leak - 19 hours labor to remove engine etc. - $3 000 repair. Took it to the Toyota dealership for a second opinion  not telling them of the first. Diagnosis: two oil leaks  one small oil gasket  one large power steering fluid leak  replace rack and pinion assembly - total costs for both repair $1 400. Power steering leak not bad enough to alert low fluid levels  noises or function impairment. We don’t see two oil leaks on the ground. Zero mention of timing cover leak. Now we have a third mechanic set up to look at it. Whatcha all think? Thank ye kindly.3

So  yeah  the labor is going to be astronomicalBut I don’t know how bad the leak is. How often do you have to top off  and how much? Can you live with that  or are you the type of person who will not tolerate any leaks or spots on the driveway?My brother has the same engine in his 2008 Highlander  but with electric power steering. Anyways  he’s had a few SEVERE oil leaks over the years. That oil hose going to the cylinder head catastrophically let go one day  without any warning sign at all. I replaced it with a steel line for a one year newer Highlander. Perfect fit.The engine oil cooler hoses also let go catastrophically  some years later. Again  no warning whatsoever. I replaced it with an updated part. The updated part was all steel  no rubber hoses to leak.I suspect your timing cover leak may not be bad enough to warrant that $3000 repair.My brother’s timing case has been leaking for years. But it’s a very slow leak  and there are no spots on the driveway.As for that power steering rack needing to be replaced . . . I assume the bellows is wet or damp. that means the internal seals are no longer doing their job. Technically  that means you should replace the rack. But again  what is your comfort level?You could probably drive the car for years without doing the repairs  but I can’t exactly advise that without seeing and driving the car

We all ignored them because they were the norm.Totally agree with @db4690  if you aren’t seeing any stains on the driveway  I wouldn’t even call them leaks. Once you see actual drops of liquid - not just a spot - I’d see about having it fixed.

I believe it’s because the oil level sender o-ring is bad  causing oil to trickle down.Anyways  the car has a large plastic splash pan  which prevents any oil from hitting my drivewayAnd I frequently check the oil level. I actually don’t even have to top off. It looks far worse than it is.Maybe I’ll replace that o-ring and reseal the pan at the next service . . . or maybe not

The first is to set up a meeting with the president of your dealership. Explain your situation and your feelings about your treatment. Failing resolution at this level  you have no choice but to contact the Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAMVAP). It is an independent third party that presents a consumer’s case before the courts if necessary. The following excerpt is from its web site (camvap.ca):The Canadian Motor Vehicle Arbitration Plan is a program where disputes between consumers and vehicle manufacturers about alleged manufacturing defects or implementation of the manufacturers’ new vehicle warranty can be put before a neutral third party (arbitrator) for resolution.Most of the time  cases don’t reach court. I can tell you from personal experience (because I guided a relative through this process) that before it got presented to the courts  a resolution was reached once the dealer found out that CAMVAP was involved. Although this sounds intimidating  remember that car manufacturers provide a service as well as a sales outlet. If they want to keep you as a customer  they will bargain in good faith. At the very least  a three-way split of the service costs (between the dealer  General Motors and yourself) should be one of your options.

It was a 38 Chrysler 2 passenger coupe with what looked like a 56 Desoto Fireflight Hemi.

Ford did some  IMO  dumb things with their engines. For example a 260 SBF can not easily  If at all  be converted to a 289! As far as the 289  unbelievably thousands of people think a 1957 Hawks’ 289 is a Ford!

You’re spending around $13 000 for the parts alone though.

Rather than repairing a vehicle that gets 13 MPG I would buy one that gets 30 MPG.

Try driving with just a single key in the ignition as an experiment. No dangling keys attached. If it never happens or happens much less frequently  suspect the ignition switch. Beyond that  next time you are in the shop to bring the routine maintenance up to date  ask them to also double-check the warm idle rpm and ignition timing.

Bought it 17 days ago. Dealer told me they had taken the engine apart to replace solenoid and everything else was good. Had a new brake job and fresh oil change too.Drove out of town (700mi trip) on the way home noticed car was shifting slower and at higher RPMs. No check engine light  but took it to a transmission shop to see if they could confirm the transmission was working. After their assessment they told me there were two engine codes they did not erase  didn’t tell me what they were but said to get the car back to dealer as it wasn’t a tranny issue.I went straight to the dealer (this happened 8 days post purchase and inside their two week return no questions asked timeframe) to ask them to tell me what was going on. I told them what the tranny shop said. They kept the vehicle overnight  claimed it was “driving as designed” and all they did was fix an open wiper sensor recall at no charge to me.I was sick and didn’t drive the car again for almost a week.Car “threw a rod” on the highway in morning rush hour traffuc. Dealer sent a tow truck to collect the vehicle. Told me they didn’t have a loaner so my daughter and I had to get a cab to get back home. I heard nothing from them  but when I called later that day the service guy said it was a rod and they would cover the repair.It’s been two business days and I’ve heard nothing. This was a used as-is car and the dealer is not obligated to do these repairs so - on the one hand I’m glad for their help - I also don’t want a lemon that is just being patched together to get me past their 30 day exchange window.I really wanted this car  but need to be smart. Should I be walking away from this vehicle?1

Let the dealer repair it. I’d guess that even As-Is sales in your state have a 30 or 90 day warranty because I can’t see many dealers doing this kind of expensive work for free if they weren’t forced to. Of course they DID have the engine apart once before…Based on your post  you really have no idea about what is or was wrong with the vehicle and haven’t told us anything concrete but that it threw a rod. Impossible for me to conclude that it is a lemon with this little info.See what you have when it comes back. And have a little patience  if this thing threw a rod it will take roughly a day to get the engine out  a few days to get the new or rebuilt engine and a day and a half to install it assuming they started on it right away.Also  when you bought this car  you believed the dealer (dealers lie!) and didn’t have an independent mechanic look this As-Is vehicle over before you bought it. Now  I can’t guarantee your mechanic would have advised against buying it but you just walked in blindly and bought it. Always have the car inspected before you buy it. It is the cheapest $100 you’ll ever spend. Good Luck

Y’know a BRAKE warning light!As for this: [ had the brakes inspected and everything is ok ] I’d say that is an incorrect answer since very clearly there IS a brake issue. Maybe just checked the wheel brakes and not the ABS controls. You need a mechanic who can dig deeper. One that has a diagnostic reader that can read the ABS information so this can be fixed.

The pan won’t clear the crankshaft and the crossmember without lifting the engine. That means un-bolting at least one engine mount and maybe 2. You need a way to lift the engine from the top while you can still get under the truck to remove the pan.Given your financial problems  I’d suggest buying some epoxy putty at a marine supply store. Drain the oil. Clean the loose rust and oil off the pan at the leaks and apply a layer of the mixed putty all over the bad spots and let dry. Might buy you some time.

The only thing I can suggest is that you check all grounds.I would recommend that you buy a spare ballast resistor and keep it in the glove box. They are the usual cause of a crank but no start for these cars. If you check for spark and you get one spark and no more while cranking  it is the ballast resistor. They are cheap.

There is an air gap between the converter and the heat shield. The air flow between the two provides a lot of the cooling/insulation. If you wrap the converter  even only at the top  you will contain the heat  might even make it worse. I doubt a hose clamp would survive the heat anyway.

Air flow is essential for heat shields around wood stoves  so it would logically apply here as well. Static build up is not safe.

When that happens  key ON  radio OFF  does the fuel pump hum? No hum  bad fuel pump or fuel pump relay. Swap the relay with a similar one for something not needed in the fuse block. Try to restart. No go?Next pull a plug wire and hold it close to a good ground to check if it has spark when the engine is cranked. No spark  check the coil first. Good coil  swap in a new ignition module.

The situation is that this car is likely to be “retired” in approximately 2 weeks regardless of what the nature of this issue is  so I really don’t want to put any significant money into it  but I do need it to last me those two weeks  including being loaded up with stuff and driven 2-3 hours for a move. After that  it’s pretty much fine if it bursts into flames.Some relevant background info:Recently the check engine and TRAC Off lights came on. I took it in for diagnosis and the computer codes were for two bad catalytic converters. I didn’t have anything done about it because it wasn’t worth putting the money in knowing that I was going to junk it soon.Current symptoms:It’s possible some of these issues were already starting before  but when I noticed a clear problem was today a little bit after filling it up with gas. It seems like it’s misfiring. It idles rough  particularly when it’s in drive. Smooths out quite a bit when in park  although not always 100%. It also smooths out when I’m actually driving it. Basically I get up to 10-15 mph and it starts to feel okay. But then  the engine check light starts blinking. Usually when I’m idling the light is solid  although that’s not a perfect 1-to-1 correlation; sometimes it continues blinking. I also think I’m noticing a sort of sulfur-like  rubbery smell. And when I took it on the highway  around 60-65mph  the tach was reading about 3500 and it didn’t seem to shift into its highest gear. Lastly  although I know effectively nothing that would help me diagnose the issue  I popped the hood to see if there was anything obviously wrong. I noticed that the outer plastic case of the engine had a crack in it (see picture). I have literally no idea if this is a problem or whether or not it is even a new development  but I figured I’d mention it in case it’s relevant.Car Talk Community  you’ve helped me several times before. Anyone know what’s going on and whether I risk blowing myself up or anything by continuing to drive this dying machine?6

I had it looked at because I was concerned about loading it up with stuff and trying to take it on the highway. The diagnosis was a faulty ignition coil. I went ahead and had it fixed because the cost wasn’t all that much more than figuring out some way to get by for the next two weeks and then renting a car or Uhaul for the journey  and was way more convenient. I suppose I could have rolled the dice  but once my early-20s became relegated to the rear view  I became a bit more risk averse.

On cable operated throttles  they can get stuck in a position  worst case fully on. The motor can shift and mess up alignment with the propulsion mechanisms (e.g. drive shaft). It could end up far worse than an inconvenience. It needs to be fixed. A prime opportunity to learn something new and minimize costs by doing it yourself. Even better if you can find someone to lead you through it in person…

If I top both of them up I’ll have to do it again within the next 2 days and my temperature gauge will rise from the middle close to the top (sometimes right on the line) and go back down to the middle but never actually overheat and start smoking. I believe I have a major water leak somewhere  but I’m not seeing any drips underneath the car?I’ve also looked online and seen some info on a broken/cracked head gasket  but I don’t have the frothy  milky colored oil that you would see if it were. I’m getting a new car soon and just need this one to at least last me the next 2 weeks (3 if I’m lucky).I’m just trying to get an idea of what I need done and what’s going on  any tips can help!

It the exhaust is leaking you may not see that in the oil.If you need to keep it running for 2 or 3 weeks  go to a McParts store and get some magic in a jar that is supposed to fix a head gasket leak. May or may not work. Keep an eye on the radiator and temperature. You may get lucky and get your 3 weeks.

Many pressure leaks in hoses etc can blow out coolant unseen. If it was my car and I lived in a cooler climate I might consider loosening the radiator cap to prevent coolant from blowing out. In an old car I made it a few hundred miles until I could get to a town with parts. Not sure how that woulds work in your car.

If you can do something with borrowed money that you can’t do otherwise and that thing results in lower total costs even including the interest you pay  you’ve saved by borrowing.In light of how you’ve maintained your transmission so far  most likely you will drive it until it fails completely  at which time you will have to pay the price of the accident you may cause and deal with the failure catastrophically. If you borrow money now to fix your transmission now  then maintain it properly and drive in a transmission-friendly manner (the transmission of my '87 works as well as it did new) you will pay less in total. Unless you decide to stop owning a car instead.The most cost-efficient practice is to save money before you need to spend it; that way you collect interest instead of paying it  you get to shop for the best price & transmission (etc.)  you don’t have to drive a defective unsafe vehicle.

Of course it’s better not to use credit  but after all that’s what its for if you don’t have the cash. In the old days before national credit cards  businesses would usually carry accounts for people for repairs  or merchandise. Now they just take credit cards.

It is much better to be able to drive your car to an independent trans shop  rather than winding-up stranded in an inconvenient place  at an inconvenient time.

But I guess if you are careful you can avoid problems where you need reverse. The 1st to 3rd problem could eventally wear out the clutches I suppose. Has a good trans shop had an opportunity to do a proper diagnosis? It’s possible (albeit unlikely) there could be a relatively simple fix available  like a replacement solenoid.

I checked for leaks using propane. Air filter  spark plugs  oil filter are all new. I poured Seafoam fuel additive and it did absolutely nothing. I pushed throttle in neutral–no effect. Engine mounts seem to be good. Only 47k miles. There are no noises other than when I step on the pedal on the road I can hear a howling  hallow noise… like wind in a tunnel. What do I check next?17

Anyway  I put in a new sensor and the check engine light went off. I will check that duct again. I already unbolted it once. It still looks new. Besides  I read that if there if a vacuum leak  the rpm will go up at idle. But the rpm is at 800 and steady. It was 750 before I changed the MAF sensor.

It may be different for another car  but should be possible to find on Chevrolet-specific forums.

If they don’t pan out  ask your shop to check for diagnostic codes again  and let us know what the fuel trim measurements are. It sounds to me like it is idling too lean  which should show up in the fuel trims

They only check it if it is on.I suspect that it could be I lean too. But I can’t find any vacuum leak. I cracked open the filter cover and nothing changed. I checked with propane.I checked the resistance on the ignition coils and all 4 were the same. And they were all getting 12V. And I don’t see any bad hoses. All still firm. I can’t find the PCV valve though. Maybe there isn’t one. There is a hose under the intake housing that connects to the engine and it is firm. Fuel pump seems to be working. I disconnected the fuse to it and car would not start. Put it back  it started right up.But maybe it is lean. I am thinking of buying an engine scanner myself. Is there a basic one that will graph the fuel trims?

You could also check to see if certain readiness monitors have run to completion.NEVER go to Advance Auto . . . or autozone  for that matter . . . for advice on car repairs or diagnosis. They are not mechanics and their advice is free. That should tell you somethingOn this website  the advice is also free. But there are a lot of mechanics and extremely knowledgeable and experienced diy guys on here.Only go to an auto parts store to buy auto parts  nothing else.

You might surf over to their website and take a peek. I don’t own any vehicles post 1992 model year  so I don’t need an OBD II scanner myself. But for fuel trim I think you need one that advertises “mode 6”  or “freeze frame”  or “real time data”  something wording like that. HF usually has a downloadable user manual for each product  so you can see exactly what each model does in detail by reading those. [ I can’t find the PCV valve though. Maybe there isn’t one. ] On the 2.9L engine there isn’t a PCV valve per se  but there is a PCV orifice tube  which performs sort of the same function. It’s plugged into a hole at the top of what looks to me like the valve cover  and is connected via a short 90 degree hose to the intake manifold. There’s a fresh air inlet from the air cleaner resonator on the opposite side of the injectors. A plugged or leaking pcv system will result in rough idle.

On newer cars or trucks  the throttle body flange is covered in a clear coat to improve air flow. Using carb cleaner could potentially remove this delicate coating. Another thing to keep in mind is that throttle body cleaner is safe on the electronic sensors where as carb cleaner is not.I knew about the sensor issue but clear coat?? Waddya Know!

When the engine is cranking or running  the big pulley (and crankshaft) turn counterclockwise. That’s the direction you should turn it by hand.Look at the pictures of the timing belt in place. Its left side is a straight shot from camshaft pulley down to the small pulley behind the big pulley. You want the pull to be via that straight shot  which only happens in counterclockwise motion of the crankshaft/big pulley/harmonic balancer/timing belt toothed pulley behind the big pulley.IIRC from doing this a couple months ago: after installing the belt  and before tightening the tensioner pulley in place  turn the big pulley by hand counterclockwise 2 turns then check that timing marks up top and down below are still OK. If so  tighten the tensioner pulley’s bolt to spec.I am away from my Haynes and the instruction sheet that came with my timing belt kit  and able to take correction if called for.The fact that the Honda engine turns counterclockwise means you may need a special tool to hold the big pulley in place while you unscrew  counterclockwise  the big bolt that holds it on  at major (130 foot-pounds?) torque. And need it again to tighten the big bolt.

A timing belt alignment just isn’t that difficult when you only have to deal with one crank pulley and one camshaft pulley. I think the problem may be that you are not checking the ignition timing correctly. And the reason is the timing light you are using. I presume you have a timing light with an ‘advance/retard’ knob on it  right? That’s why you ask above if the timing light should be set to 12 degrees. The problem is that the instructions to check the ignition timing probably assume you only have a basic timing light  one with no advance/retard knob. So it is always set to 0 degrees; i.e. it lights up at exactly the time the number one spark plug fires. With that type of timing light  which is the type most diy’ers have  with the engine idling you shine the timing light to align two marks the manufacturer provides  one on the crank pulley  and one that’s stationary  attached to the engine. When those marks align  the timing is automatically set at 12 degrees btdc. When you set your timing light to 12 degrees that won’t work  and I think that is what is confusing you.

I’m not familiar with that timing light  nor which marks mean what on your engine; but I do expect that timing light setting is where the confusion is happening. You might try what you did before  but this time setting the timing light at 0 degrees  see if Honda’s ignition timing check directions make more sense then.On my Corolla I just align the marks as shown in the manual using a 0 degree (no advance/retard function) timing light. I verify while doing that that I’m able to move the marks a little past or a little before the correct alignment by turning the distributor. Then I briefly bump the rpm and verify the timing advances from the idle setting.

The marks might be lined up at bottom dead center rather than top dead center. It could be an ignition issue or one of a dozen other issues.The OP thinks he is going to learn something from this experience  but this is a 20 year old car and he is trying to diagnose it based on assumptions from people who haven’t even seen the car.Unless the OP is willing to let this car sit in his driveway for the foreseeable future  he needs to employ a professional automotive diagnostician to figure out what is wrong with the car  because what is wrong with a 20 year old car might have no relation to the timing belt at all.This isn’t a learning experience  it’s an exercise in futility. There is no logic to this exercise. It’s all just a vast waste of time  because even with our help  the OP doesn’t have the skill set to figure out what is wrong and fix it. [ Suggest to let someone here who has actually done ignition timing on your engine weigh in on this. ] What if it’s not a timing issue? This car has automatically adjusting ignition timing  so if the timing is the issue  something is malfunctioning that can’t be solved with a timing light and a screwdriver. It could be something as simple as the replacement distributor being installed incorrectly  or even the spark plug wires being connected in the wrong order.The problem here is that the OP doesn’t have the right mindset. He is making assumptions about work he has already done  refusing to consider that his previous work might be the issue. Any one of the parts the OP has installed might be defective. Any one of the parts the OP installed might have been installed incorrectly. Something unrelated to the work the OP has done might be broken or malfunctioning  but as long as the OP is working based on what might be faulty assumptions  this car is going to sit.

Next  there’s two marks on the crank pulley  one red and one white. And a pointer attached to the engine timing belt cover. The white mark corresponds to tdc  the red to 12 dbtc (or 16 if you have that version of the engine). With your timing light knob set to zero degrees  (or with the type of timing light most of us diy’ers use without the advance/retard knob)  the pointer should line up with the red mark at idle rpm  warm engine. If you dialed in 12 degrees advance on your hi-tech timing light  then the pointer should line up with the white mark.

The reverse current through a diode bridge is a lot lower because it has to go through two diodes in series  as well as two coils.The only schematic I can access right now is for a Toyota alternator. It is interesting as it is an ungrounded wye wound generator  but the diode bridge is delta connected to the coils. When the engine is off  parasitic current through the alternator has to go through the three diodes on the + side  then through two coils per diode in series and then through the three diodes to the neg side. In other words  there are three parallel paths each involving a diode  two coils and another diode in series.Now the book I am looking in has two alternators  one with an internal IC regulator and one with the mechanical external regulator. In the mechanical regulator  there is a set of contacts that open when the engine is off that takes the alternator out of the circuit  but it looks like a shorted diode on the + side might energize the coil and make the contacts.The internals of the IC is not shown  but the alternator has a total of 12 diodes with the IC regulator. 6 are in the bridge  the rest support the IC.

There may be some small current going the other way but the way we tested them was with an ohm meter to see if you got a reading one way but not the other. I guess its splitting hairs  but if I got a reading both ways I’d know it was bad.

If you had used a higher scale  you would have seen some needle movement on your Simpson 260.

Typically  they are: Peak reverse voltage: 200 volts Average forward current  max: 35 amps Peak surge current: 200 amps VF: 1.05 volts IR at 200 volts: 50µA RR time: 15µsnote that the IR is at 25ºC. It doubles for every 10ºC increase  so at 95º that would be 6 mA. But typical would be a lot lower  and also lower because actual voltage is 15 volts  not 200 volts.

Thanks for the diode discussion.So going back to the testing  I finally had a chance to pull the fuses one at a time. As I said  the Fiat 850 has a total of 10 fuses  8 below the dash on the driver’s side  one on the rear with the engine (yes  the engine is in the back and it spins counterclockwise  btw)  and another one on the right-hand of the steering wheel under the dash. I was unable to find the last two fuses  but the other 8 were pulled one by one and there was no significant drop in amperage.I’m not sure if I can rebuild the alternator as galant suggests (and yes  this car does have an alternator AND a regulator). Replacing one will cost me about $300 plus labor  and very few mechanics are willing to even bother with these cars nowadays. Imagine that  no computers to tell you what’s wrong…shameful.So  unless the draw is coming from the two fuses I could not locate  can I assume that the draw is coming from the alternator due to a faulty diode? Am I way off?I will upload the entire electrical diagram if it helps to diagnose the issue. I will scan the user’s manual which includes one (pretty cool  if you ask me).BTW oldtimer 11  my bad on the math. Yes  I know how to use math with multiples of 10. I grew up with the metric system  but then again  I’m human. Sorry about that.Thanks again  Rodrigo

Since the alternator lead is HOT to the battery it would be best to first disconnect the negative battery lead before removing the main lead and make sure it is isolated from touching anything after it is removed. If the current draw is still there then you have proved the alternator is okay and the hunt is still on. Disconnect other things that you suspect may be causing the problem. Once you find and disconnect the path the problem is on the current will drop and you need to trace the wiring to the problem. Looking at the wire colors that has the power on it may help you locate the other end of the wiring and the problem.

I found a remanufactured one on eBay for about $300. I will test amperage drain on the one installed later today if the weather cooperates. This will hopefully determine if it needs to be replaced (I certainly hope not :-).

Most midsize and bigger cities have them. They are usually locally owned  often long-standing  and have a wealth of knowledge and new and old parts to repair or replace your component.

I much rather pay a local guy to rebuild my old one. If what an alternator contains is nothing more than copper  diodes and other electrical components  surely it could be rebuilt. And yes  I do live in a large metro area. I’ll google it.I’m still unable to test the alternator as it is raining  cold and nasty outside today…

It is a very simple install. Since you say that you have no charge warning light you could install one and run power from the ignition switch through the warning light and then to the L lead of the alternator. Add a battery sense lead from the old regulator wiring and that’s it. The hardest thing is getting something to match your mounting points on the engine. It shouldn’t cost much either.

Back when  on mine a complete rebuild would include the front and rear bearings  a new voltage regulator  brushes  and a diode trio. I’d do it about every 70-80K just as a pre-emptive repair. Then they made it so it was hard to take apart requiring replacement. About a half hour for a good auto electric repair shop if they can get the parts.

I am keen to listen for different noises made by my engine  so when this appeared I had to investigate (turn to google). Its 10pm here  all the auto parts shops are closed  and I went over to my vehicle to check the filter. I did so  making sure to keep the airbox more or less closed after removing the filter  but my concern is that some airborn dust may have inevitably made it beyond the filter.I’d like to hear thoughts on this. Do you think any dust may have gotten inside  and if so is it a good idea to start the engine? If not what is something I can do about it? I understand that past the filter  the air goes directly into the engine combustion chamber (if I’m not wrong). I’d imagine the dust may have mixed with the oil at this point  and I’d rather not destroy it.4

The car is a bit of an embarrassment  windows aren’t working  timing belt  tires worn  most of all the oil consumption is off the chart. … But it runs well  sort of. So what to replace it with?

If you discover you have a little more money  maybe go for a slightly newer model. 3-5 years old is the sweet spot imo  where you get the most bang for the buck. When buying a used carsee what the Consumer Reports used car guide has to say about its predicted reliabilityhave it inspected by your own mechanic before writing any checksmake sure the check engine light comes on when it should (engine not running  key in on)  and goes off when it should (engine running)The only problem of any import I’m seeing mentioned about this vehicle is a problem with the heated o2 sensor connectors degrading & throwing a p003X diagnostic code.

The cheapest place for this sort of used car  in my limited experience  is in the upper class suburbs. If they have a 12 year old car for sale they just want to get rid of it  and you can often get it at a good price. Sometimes it’s the teenaged kid’s first car  in which case I’d say skip it  but then again it can be a grandma car or a commute from home to a train station car  which can be good.

If the air filter and its ductwork are intact  no moth will get there. Even very fine particles of dust will be blocked by an intact correct air filter  if its gaskets and ductwork are not damaged.

The only thing I can think of is that the moths are living and reproducing downstream of the air cleaner element or there is a broken part in the ducting allowing them in. Crazy. Four times is the key part of the story. And why are they ending up on the mass airflow sensor instead of being aspirated. Maybe those are just the ones that hit that spot and many were.

I can’t imagine how they’d get there though  unless the air filter was in really bad shape. Like it got wet and that resulted in a hole through the element. Sometimes air cleaners can catch fire if the engine back-fires  so that’s another possibility. Occasionally small rodents will make a home in the air filter box  and chew on the filter. More likely imo  during a tune-up or debug session techs (or somebody like a diy’er) ran the engine without the air filter. A moth incident could happen then.Have the MAF cleaned  new air filter  all the rubber boots for the air intake tract inspected. You should be good to go at that point. If somebody who’s not experienced in auto repair has been working on your car  ask them if they ran the engine without the air filter. Just doing that for 2 minutes could cause this. I should know  I had that problem myself idling my truck without the air filter  for testing purposes. The engine suddenly died  for no apparent reason. Inspection showed some sort of substance had got sucked into an air bleed port.

I have it regularly serviced by Honda. Also  this is at least the fourth time this has happened  although only two have been diagnosed as moths.The gaskets etc were checked at this last tow and no problems. The air filter was hardly dirty.The first stall was looked at as a fluke and didn’t require towing. The second time was a mystery  too  but needed a tow from the middle of a busy intersection. Honda engineers were stumped  but guessed it was the EGR valve and it was replaced. There may have been a time earlier  but the car just stalled and restarted. the problem seems to be worsening. Two additional tows from very busy highways now.My problem is that I am rather gun shy to drive this car. three tows in the past 30K miles.

How do I get some attention from Honda that this is a seriously flawed minivan? I ] I expect they already know it has a flaw. And I presume they’ve already done the basic tests  fuel pressure  battery voltage  egr operation  etc  & checked the computer memory for diagnostic codes  etc. And done the stuff suggested in my post above. It seems like their plan is for the problem to either fix itself  or get worse  at which point it will be so apparent they’ll be able to diagnose it. That’s a pretty routine way for shops to handle this sort of intermittent-stall thing. Doing anything more is just not practical or economical in most cases.But I can see how such a thing would be frustrating. There has to be an explanation for how moths got into the air flow meter  as an engine properly buttoned up in the oem configuration  with a new air filter  that’s all but impossible. The only plausible explanation is that there were months in the air filter when it was installed  or they were flying around in the shop and got in there and trapped.If I had that problem myself  as a diy’er I’d ignore the moth issue  thinking it is some kind of weird one-of-a-kind problem  and instead install some simple instrumentation so I could monitor the battery voltage  fuel pump voltage  ignition system primary voltage  fuel pressure  and egr status as I drove. I expect one of those would show a fault at the same time as the stall; then I’d have a clue what went wrong. I doubt your dealership is able to do that for you. So the next best thing is to ask them to have a staff-tech drive your car as their daily driver  and bring along their test equipment in the truck. And lend you one of their cars in the meantime. Whether they’ll do that for you  don’t know  but doesn’t hurt to ask. One idea: Politely remind them that you’d like to continue to be a loyal Honda customer for your future car purchases. Best of luck.

I agree that it just probably not economical for them to spend much time on it. Since the moth explanation has been used for two of the three tows  it must be a standard excuse.

And eating through the filter is the only way I can think of for a moth to get back there without a hole in the intake.

I’ve used a discarded white t-shirt for doing that. Some oil sludge deposits can be pretty hard substances. You could also see what happens when you heat the grit up. If it melts  probably plastic. I expect it is oil sludge deposits  and means you should change your oil and filter a little more frequently. Especially true if your car has variable valve timing.Did you recently switch from conventional dinosaur to synthetic oil? If so  this is probably normal.

Then I’m thinking the same as VDC above. Whatever the source  turbo unit or elsewhere  some kind of carbon/coke deposits have broken loose. Carbon/coke can be differentiated from most plastics b/c It won’t melt at any reasonable temperature. Years ago I had a summer job where I’d have to test the melting point of certain precursors of plastic. What we used was sort of a hot plate equipped with a thermocouple and a microscope. We’d turn the hotplate up and watch when it melted  then we’d note the temperature from the thermocouple. OP could figure out a way to do something like that I suppose.

Thermoplastics do melt  thermoset plastics don’t - think bakelite or phenolics. They turn to a crusty burnt product much like the OP describes.I think that lends credence to yours and @VDCdriver’s “turbo oil coke deposits” theory.

Now that the OP has changed the oil 3 or 4 times in 13k miles  using Mobil-1 (NOT “Mobile” 1 )  some of the coked deposits in the turbo have been loosened  and have been washed into the crankcase.

If it were mine I’d probe it with something to find out how deep it is. Then guesstimate by its depth and orientation there are any broken threads. Even then it is up to someone’s judgment. If there are broken threads  it’s likely some distortion of the sidewall would show up. If there is none  I would tell myself not to worry about it. But I would probably still worry  or at least do some watchful waiting…How close are you (years  miles) to needing new tires?

Look carefully for exposed cords in the deepest part of the tear. If none look carefully at the tire from the side to see if there is any bulging or swelling of the sidewall; not just the torn piece sticking up some but the tire wall actually pushing out some.If you have a road hazard warranty you might be covered. Check it out. Otherwise  if the tire passed the tests you have done about pressure and what I would do  I would continue to use the tire. What you decide to do is up to you.

Purchased it with 76 000 on it and it now has 90 000. All of a sudden I started having some kind of suspension issue  it feels as if any or all of the wheels may fall off at anytime which is what happened. I had the left rear ball joint give way at 30mph no resulting damage and had the car towed and repaired. Since then I have replaced the remaining 5 ball joints so all are now new. I have also replaced all struts   control arms  sway bar links and rotors and pads. The wheels still feel as if their ready to fall off. I also replaced both c.v. joints. These repairs were all done withen the last 2 weeks. While making sharp left turn such as a U turn the left front wheel seems to clunk as if it’s not rolling properly. I have checked the bearings which seem to be okay. I have checked all bolts for any loosness and all the bushings seem to be okay. Anyone got any ideas what this is?

But it’s not under pressure.On a fuel injected engine  the system holds what’s called residual fuel pressure.https://www.bing.com/search?q=residual%20fuel%20pressure&pc=cosp&ptag=G6C999A005A2B4283&form=CONBDF&conlogo=CT3210127 1Residual fuel pressure slowly bleeds down to prevent vapor lock.But eventually there will be no fuel pressure as the vehicle sits idle.As long as there’s a column of fuel in the fuel line and fuel rails to the injectors  and the fuel pump runs for the 1-2 seconds when the ignition switch is first turned on  the fuel pressure will be immediately restored.That’s because you can’t compress a liquid.Tester

Proper testing of the charging system and the batteries will show where the problem is at. The alternator output might have a problem and can’t produce the full rated output it should be capable of or  there may be a problem with the wiring between the alternator output and the batteries. Checking the voltage drop between the alternator output lead and the batteries with a good load on the electrical system will answer that question. This is a simple problem to solve and any good shop should have the answer to it without much trouble shooting time involved.

For the last few years  it has been making a creaking/groaning sound at low speeds. Generally between 10-20 miles an hour (so you hear in more in rush hour when you are generally annoyed anyway)  only when its hot (due to extensive driving or weather - we live in Texas so its awful in the summer) and it does not correlate to using the brakes. We took it to Honda and they said the “bushings” were worn but not broken so they wouldn’t fix it. Our own shop has replace both front control arms. The right side they did last week and 3 days later the sound is starting up again. Its almost as if they can lube it to fix it temporarily but I’d much rather a permanent fix. My father in law suggested the struts. Any ideas?2

The brake pads rub the rotors when you are not toughing them so it could cause a sound that you only hear at low speeds. A light touch of the brakes might not make it go away  but a heavier application should either make it go away or change the sound somehow.It could also be something caught between the brake shield and the rotor  or the brake shield might be touching the rotor.Another source of this type of groaning is the spring seat  the spring is moving very slightly against the seat and making this sound  although there should be some correlation with braking and acceleration as that tends to move the front end up and down more.

You describe the problem perfectly. I have a 2008 Honda Accord as well  and I’ve had this issue for years. Mine now has 134 000 miles on it. Every time I’ve taken it in to get it looked at for this problem  the shop is unable to recreate it  probably because the car is not warm enough yet. The only reply you have to this post is completely clueless. These “solutions” have nothing to do with the sound that we are experiencing.

You only did the first one but you got ALL the codes meaning that ALL cylinders have an issue. All the spark plugs wouldn’t fail at once  sooo…P0300 Causes ( = Most Common)*Faulty or worn spark plugs *Faulty spark plug wires or coils *Distributor failure *Faulty fuel injector *Vacuum leakLow fuel pressureCamshaft sensor defectiveCrankshaft sensor defectiveEngine timing offLeaking head gasketLow engine compressionPoor quality fuelStart with the 3rd one down and get your detective hat on. If this is a 6 cylinder (you don’t say) focus on cylinders 1 2 and 3. Likely the camshaft sensor on that side. Check compression to make sure it isn’t a head gasket first  though. Good Luck

Starting off by replacing the spark plugs was a good guess. But since it didn’t work … this is where I’d start:Vacuum system check. Test the brake booster’s ability to hold vacuum  and whether spraying starter spray around the intake manifold has any effect.Measure the fuel rail pressure.Check for cat damageAre you able to determine the fuel trims?

No sound at all or a clicking sound? Do your head lights work? If they do you have some juice in the battery  but not enough to run the starter. If the lights do not come on the battery is done for  or the cables are so corroded that they cannot pass electricity. Do you have access to a volt meter? The battery should give you 12.5 volts or more if it is charged.

The cables can also corrode inside their plastic covering  and there can be poor connections at the other ends of the cables. There can be enough current delivered to light the lights  but not enough to meet the high demands of the starter motor.

When I arrived at work  I got out  and found that I was a little bit too far from the curb for my taste. When I got back in the car to restart it to fix my bad parking  it wouldn’t start. There was no crank  no click  no nothing. Odd. It had literally been off for 30 seconds. I went into work and came out a few hours later and tried again. Same thing. No crank. No click. But  all of the electronics - radio  blower  wipers - worked fine. Two hours later (five hours after arrival) I tried again  armed with a multi-meter. Nothing. The battery measured fine  12.5v no load  11.5 under load (blower running  radio on.) So  I called for a tow. I went out to meet the truck  this was now about 6.5 hours after driving to work  and thought I’d give it one last try. It started right up! It did so 5 or 6 times in a row. I sent the tow truck away and went back to work. When I left work an hour and a half later  the car started fine  and I got home. When I parked the car at home and turned it off and tried to restart - no crank  no click. Weird.The next morning  I got up  the car started right up  and I took it to my mechanic. Of course  when I got there  I couldn’t get the problem of the previous day to manifest  but I left it anyway. They had the car for two days  and couldn’t get the same results either. They even let if warm up for 25 minutes at one or two points to see if a warm engine was the issue. Nothing. So  they sent me away not knowing what the issue was. The owner suspects it’s the starter failing  but doesn’t feel he can sell me on it since he can’t say for sure.Over the last couple of weeks. I’ve been driving it much less  and mostly only when I’d go from home to work where the car would sit for 8+ hours before restarting. I’ve not had any issues.Until today. I got gas  stopped at the auto parts store to pick up some coolant (and checked for error codes with their computer - no codes came up)  and a store. When I left the store  I had the same issue. No crank  no click. Just as I was resolved to walk the rest of the way to work  I decided to try it one last time. It started right up. So  this time  it was only down for 5 minutes or so  but it seemed to be the same issue arising again.I’m baffled. Any ideas on this one?12

Recently my car has had trouble starting  well sometimes it turns on and sometimes it doesn’t and i have to either wait a few minutes or sometimes it won’t even turn on anymore. I changed the starter and even got a new battery as the problem continued. I had the vehicle checked out by a mechanic twice but it just so happened that each time it was checked the car started without a problem >.> they said that maybe the battery was starting to go bad so I got a new one.

Evenif you have a new battery  if the connections are loose  dirty or corroded  you will not beallowing the full flow of current to pass thru the connections. The connection may beenough to turn on the lights  but not enough for the huge flow that is needed to operate thestarter. This is where many people say that they know the battery is good….”because thelights come on”. This is no more a battery test than licking a 9volt battery. It only tells you that there is electricity…not how many volts or the amperage that flows from the battery.Jump starting may have wiggled the terminal just enough to allow the current to pass and start the engine  but tomorrow you have the same problem.First remove the cables from the battery and use a wire brush to remove any corrosion and dirt from the battery posts and the cable terminals. There is a tool with a round wire brush for this purpose  found at any auto parts store for less than $10 http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/kd-tools-terminal-battery-brush-kdt201/25980576-P?searchTerm=terminal+brush 1.Before connecting the cables  apply a coating of di-electric grease to the battery posts this will keep oxygen away from the connection so that it will not corrode as fast.It is just as important that the other end of the cables also have a clean connection. Remove the negative cable from the battery again so that you do not short anything out. Follow both cables to their far ends  remove this connection and wire brush the connection and the cable terminal clean and retighten these connections.If there was work done recently  there may have been an “engine to body” ground that was not installed following the work. These grounds normally run from the rear of the engine to the firewall and are uninsulated and most are a braided wire. If any of these are found unattached…reattach them.Remember….this is not a “Sherman Tank” don’t over tighten the connections.Tight…tight………………too tight…broke!!!Yosemite

That “extra” point used to rust. Check the cable along the length to see if there is a connection on metal somewhere between the engine and battery. Then wrench the bolt back and forth and see what happens.Connecting a jumper cable from engine to frame may help as a test for a bad ground. By frame I mean to a strut bolt or nut. If the blower fan or power windows seem to move too slow  a bad ground between engine and body could be the cause. Mostly not  but it could be  and often was in the past.

Trying to move the wheel back and forth sometimes helps start the car. But let the car sit for over 30 mins and it usually will start up  with or without a’ check braking system’ message which indicates like battery. However  you can get a jump if you need to get going asap. I’ve had it not start as soon as I turn off the engine then try to restart less than a minute later  but then leave it sit for a while and when I go to get a jump it starts up like nothing wrong. If I ever trade down the problem I’ll post back on here  but for now have a quick disconnect I use at times which works fine  although getting a jump box so you don’t have to home from another car is another option. Sorry there send to be no known solution that I know of  and I’ve check countless boards and forums searching for what is the cause to this problem. I’m soon heading down to a battery store in my town where they said they’d look at tracing the electrical problem to find the cause  but am waiting on another fusion owner to get back with me on whether a different place found the source to the same problem. Best of luck  and please post  whether here or in a new discussion  if you ever get a solution  it’d help so many fusion owners.

For rear wheel drive vehicles those responsibilities are divided between the front wheels (steering) and rear wheels (power). I’ve only ever owned RWD and 4WD (which are RWD 99% of the time) vehicles. With that said FWD vehicles tend to better in snow than RWD vehicles. In my experience though  I prefer the way RWD vehicles drive vs. FWD vehicles  the driving dynamics of RWD are superior in most typically encountered conditions IMHO. Also fewer design compromises have to be made for RWD.

Now your talking about my kind of truck. I had a 1950 Chevrolet one ton pickup. I well remember the floor pedal that operated the starter. The battery was under the floor on the passenger side. There was a plate one lifted to service the battery. There was a hand choke to start the engine when it was cold–no automatic choke to stick. My truck had “intermittent” wipers" . The wipers were vacuum operated and only wiped the windshield during the interval the accelerator was released. My truck even had those wonderful split rim wheels. I think there was a.provision to hand crank the engine if the battery was down  but by the time I bought the truck the hand crank had long since been lost. These old Chevrolets were real work trucks–you had to work to drive them. Depreciation was pretty high on the truck. I bought it for $115 in 1972 and sold it three years later for $110. It wasn’t a total loss. I think I was able to write the $5 depreciation off my income taxes.

On a Bendix® starter drive  the pinion was engaged by the inertia of the pinion gear as the starter motor accelerated and the pinion gear was forced into the ring gear by a spiral groove on the starter shaft. If the engine fired  the sudden speeding up of the pinion gear caused the spiral shaft to disengage  which was quite maddening if one cylinder fired but the engine did not start. A Bendix® starter did not use a starter solenoid to engage the starter pinion. Only garden tractors and outboard motors still use the Bendix system today.This is a Bendix starter drive.Bendix also made a bicycle coaster brake that used that spiral threaded shaft. Pedal forward and the gear would bottom out on the hub and drive the hub  pedal back and the spiral shaft would force the gear against a set of friction disks to brake the bike.

When I started driving  we had no front drive cars. I was in trucking for 40 years  regularly drove thector trailer between Buffalo and Watertown NYor Montreal via Watertown. To make a living doing that you had better be good and you had better be fearless. No front wheel drive heavy trucks. All of my reflexes are refined by rear drive vehicles. I can tell what any rear dive vehicle is doing on ice or snow and it doesn’t bother me. A front drive car will go a little faster on Ice and snow before it starts to slip but it is much harder to predict or control. At least for me.As long as we were talking about low gears  in the 70s I drove some cab over Fords with 250 Cummings engines and 10 speed road ranger transmissions. You had 5 speeds on the lo side of the ranger and 5 on the high. What made these trucks special was a plunger marked deep reduction. When you pulled that plunger up it gave you 5 gears UNDER first. If you had a rig truly stuck with a heavy load and pulled him out with one of these Fords with a heavy toad on the trailer you could turn the heaviest tow chain into an iron bar that wouldn’t bend.

If it’s doing that  then it’s time to replace it  which you should be able to get done for under $1K. I would guess $700  but don’t know your car.Only do it if you still like the car and it is otherwise holding together well. Otherwise find a newer car you like and spend your money there.

Check the clutch fluid reservoir  it is probably empty. I don’t think you need any transmission work  only clutch repairs.

That’s often indicative that the master or slave cylinder has failed – I usually recommend replacing them both  because if one dies  the other most likely isn’t far behind.The good news is that if your slave cylinder is external to the transmission housing (the master cylinder always is) it’ll be a lot cheaper than replacing the whole clutch.If  however  your slave is internal  I recommend replacing the clutch  because they’re in there anyway so you might as well put the new part in there so you don’t have to pay them to go back in there when the clutch does wear out.

It has hydraulic fluid in it. When you press on the clutch  it moves a part inside the master cylinder that pushes that fluid down a tube to the slave cylinder  which is at your clutch (which is between your engine and transmission).The slave cylinder pushes on a part called a fork that pulls the clutch apart so that the engine isn’t connected to the transmission anymore. That lets you put the car in gear. When you let up on the clutch  the pressure leaves the slave cylinder and that makes the clutch come together again which connects your engine and transmission and makes the car go.When a cylinder fails  the whole system can’t build up the pressure necessary to press on that fork and pull the clutch apart. Either cylinder failing can cause this symptom  but if one fails  the other isn’t usually long behind it  so it’s a good idea to tackle both at once.

I may post an update after I learn what I learn from my mechanic.

It’s a mechanical gadget that is situated in-between the transmission and the engine  and hydraulic controls which link to the clutch pedal. To service or replace some clutch parts requires removing the transmission. Clutch problems are usually either hydraulic (e.g. clutch master cylinder) or mechanical (e.g. clutch disc)   and almost all are caused by normal wear w/use. Needing a clutch repair or replacement on a 99 Accent isn’t at all unexpected. Good ideas above to focus on first what the problem is. A clutch master cylinder job is going to cost about $150 for the part and an hour labor. (There’s a new version of this part to correct a problem in the original  so make sure you get the post 9.2003 version if that’s what you need.) If the mechanical part needs replacing  the labor is around 3.5 hours to remove and replace the transmission. I’d guess another 1-1.5 hours labor to deal with the replacing the clutch parts  and maybe $400-450 for the new parts set. So all in all  not so bad. If the rest of the car remains in good shape  just a normal expenditure. The new clutch should last at least as long as the original…

Your mechanic might perform a drain and refill of the fluid but that is just maintenance.To clarify my comment “he will find something to replace”  if fluid has been lost and there is a damp spot on any of the hydraulic parts  those parts will need to be replaced  your mechanic can’t afford to have your car towed in a month from now and possibly getting stuck with the tow bill. If the parts get replaced you won’t know if it takes a month or 5 years for the fluid to leak out.

Hoses fail like check valves and hold pressure against the brake calipers. You release that pressure by cracking the bleeder. If your 19 year old car has never had them replaced  start there! If one has gone bad  expect the rest to be close behind.If you still have the problem afterwards  suspect the master cylinder but at least your brake hoses will be safe.

There’s various rubber brake hoses involved. If one of the four wheels is much hotter than the others  that’s a clue which hose it is. However  if one has failed  that’s a canary in the mine situation  so good idea to replace all the other rubber brake hoses.

So I have a 1996 Buick LeSabre. I got it from a friend after it sat for better part of a year in his driveway. There are some electrical issues  but so far nothing that required more drastic action than removing the lights inside the car.My friend let me pay it off over 10 months and naturally  one week after the final payment  the car started to have stalling issues. I noticed that the oil pressure light would come on if I was idling  either in traffic or at a light. I was stuck in traffic trying to get to work one day when it just up and stalled out of nowhere. It restarted after a few minutes  but stalled again a few miles down the road. I was able to pull it into a parking lot and look at it. The fuel line was corroded and the fuel filter was in bad shape. I had those replaced. I thought my issues were gone! However  today it stalled again.I was stuck in traffic and it stalled  restarting after about 20 minutes. The temperature gauge is reading that it’s fine. There’s gas in the tank. I checked the oil and it’s good too. However  the biggest indicator of something going on is the oil pressure light coming on.Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing the stalling? I appreciate your answers and help. Thank you.11

A careful reading of your model’s electrical diagram would disclose this.A low oil pressure light is not proof of low oil pressure. The oil pressure sender unit is usually inexpensive and easy to replace. If you want to do some DIY  consider changing it. Otherwise  a mechanic can hook up a mechanical pressure gauge to read the oil pressure - although a mechanic might replace the OP sender as a first step  anyhow.To further investigate  you’d want to find out if a stall and not restart condition involves lack of fuel or lack of spark.

It might called the sensor  the electronic control module  or pickup coil. It takes the place of “points” that were a mechanical predecessor in cars before ca. 1980. When this part fails  the spark plugs will not fire. Often if it fails  it is intermittently especially when the engine and distributor are hot  and work OK once it cools down a bit. Eventually they fail altogether.

Suggest to focus on determining why the oil pressure light is coming on  and whether the idle air control system is functioning properly. I wouldn’t mess with the MAF unless the fuel trim data indicated a problem. Beyond that  check the engine’s compression  intake manifold vacuum reading  and cat health. If possible  when it shuts off and won’t start up again  check whether you have spark at a spark plug during cranking.

One way is to have a spare spark plug and clamp or jam it somewhere on the engine  so it is grounded. Unplug one spark plug wire and plug it to that grounded spark plug. A sharp intense spark while cranking is a good sign that the ignition system is up to par.

Last night we had heavy rainfall and I found 3 inches of standing water in the back passenger side of my car. I called the upholstery company that did the work on my car and they said  “That doesn’t sound like a leaking roof. It sounds like a blocked drain pipe.” Whether or not a drain pipe is at fault I find it highly suspicious that 2 weeks after I take my car to have the top replaced I experience flooding for the first time ever! In a further pursuit to understand what could be happening  I have taken the following steps. 1) I have done some basic google searches and while I’ve found information of SUN-ROOF drain pipes I haven’t found anything on convertible drain pipes or where they might be located or how to clean them. 2) I have also performed a basic water test  pouring water over the car from top to bottom and searching for leaks on the inside of the car. NO LEAKS ARE VISIBLE - THE WATER IS VISIBLY SEEPING UP FROM THE FLOOR. 3) I have also jacked the car to examine the underside and see if any water is visibly draining. There is a small opening on the passenger side that is dripping water  I’m assuming that this is the mouth of the drain pipe? Furthermore  I am absolutely certain that the liquid is WATER as it has no weird smell or discoloration. What is going on with my car? Where is this leak coming from? Can I fix it on my own or do I need to take it to a professional? Can I get the residual water and moisture out of the interior of the car and effectively dry it out myself or do I need to hire a professional? Finally - and perhaps most importantly - IS THIS THE FAULT OF THE UPHOLSTERY COMPANY? DID THEY DAMAGE MY CAR?

Turning off the CEL without fixing the underlying problem is the automotive equivalent of touching-up the X-rays in order to conceal a malignancy. And  in any event  the light will just keep turning itself back on until the underlying problem(s) is/are repaired. [ A 2017 should still be under warranty  take it to the dealer. ] Yup! Unless the OP has racked-up an incredible number of miles in just a year or so  the car’s multiple warranties will still be in effect. Ergo… free repairs at the dealership.

My husband wanted to purchase a new Ecoboost  with a warranty and lots of gadgets. I insisted on a 2007 GT500. We roadtripped the Shelby from the Denver dealer to Phoenix  no issues. One week later  the alternator had to be replaced. Two miles out of the shop  the clutch started making strange metallic grinding noises that get worse on sharp turns and in third gear. Does this sound like the curse of the stock Shelby clutch and flywheel?11

I do not know if there is an answer. To your question. You are dealing with an eleven year old vehicle  mine is an ‘06  I have all maintenance performed at or earlier than specified and repai and replace as needed. As stated eleven year old car and who knows how the previous owner treated it. Just have the clutch taken care of and enjoy your ride. I think I would have the motor and transmission mounts closely inspected. I was just looking at a ‘13 Boss 302  but no  previous owner may have abused it. Same dealer had a brand new Rousch  which  if I had the $$$$$ would have been my choice. But my ‘06 I intend to keep alive forever.

I pampered my 06 and it never gave me any real issues. I keep waiting to walk outside and see the 07 a) on fire or b) in bits on the ground. That may be a slight exaggeration. I will take the Shelby back to my mechanics and have them figure out what the clutch is doing. Hug your 06  and may it glide into being a classic with aplomb.

No  just physics. Some Shelby’s get pampered. Some Shelby’s get run hard and put away wet. An 11 year old GT 500 needing a clutch doesn’t seem “cursed” to me at all.

The noise started yesterday and went from zero to all hell breaking loose with no warning. The Shelby clutch is normally growly and talkative - this is different.No sound when the car is cool  sounds become worse as the car warms up. Not a grinding gear noise  but like two metal files rasping on each other. Shifting is still smooth. I thought something metal got caught in the right wheelwell at first and pulled into a parking lot. Nothing.

Doesn’t sound like a clutch problem to me. However  perhaps the shifter linkage position is contributing to the problem. My first thought goes to something caught up under the car that may be rubbing on the driveshaft under hard turning or when the shifter linkage is in the right position to cause it to rub. This doesn’t seem to fit into the no noise when cool part tho- Any chance the trans is low on fluid?

No judgments! We both enjoy our toys!I agree with @TwinTurbo I think there may be something rubbing in the driveline. Anything down there transfers noises up and down the driveline. A bad engine mount may be a allowing the engine to shift a bit and causing something to rub. Any external contact will be obvious.

123495,https://community.cartalk.com/t/accord-2004-lx-stalls-in-drive-when-warm/123495,Accord 2004 LX stalls in drive when warm,Maintenance/Repairs,||accord||honda||,5,George_San_Jose1,The computer adjusts the current to the IAC to set the correct idle rpm. The input factors to the computer affecting idle rpm are brake pedal switch  power steering pressure switch  coolant temp  A/C on or off  transmission in gear vs neutral  alternator charging state. The throttle position sensor is probably another one. So checking to make sure all those are working correctly makes sense. Ignition timing has to be correct also  and the ignition system in good order. Air filter & pcv system also must be in good shape to get a good idle.The test procedure says to disconnect the evap purge connector  then connect the HDS to the DLC ( which I presume means connect up a scan tool so you can monitor the rpm) . Start engine and idle at 3000 rpm until radiator fan turns on. Then idle rpm should be 700 rpm with m/t  800 rpm w/automatic in park.

That has been causing me a few problems lately. (I believe its because the ole lady doesnt know how to drive it) but anywho  I had the transmission rebuilt at the end of July/2018  put a new wire cable on there as a result of the old one being tore up.Truck ran fine but noticed and very subtle jerk in 1st & 2nd gear after  a long duration running at free way speeds. Still proceeded to drive it regularly and had no problem. But  last week after letting ole lady drive down to the airport to work. She stated to me that the truck was dead and wasn’t starting  she tried jumping it and it started immediately. However upon putting in drive  the truck died. Jumped it again  went to put into drive and died again. She also says " there was/is this buzzing/ humming noise coming from down by the pedals. Had my friend/mechanic look at it  he claimed the problem was coming from the brake switch box. He changed the relays. And that stopped the humming noise. (She also felt the need to just tell me that while they were working and trying to figure out the problem  they noticed everytime he pushed on brake pedal  the lights inside the cab would come on as well as back brake lights.)Apparently he then put it back together. And she got in and drove it home. Now upon entering our humble abode  she threw it in reverse  backed in then went to throw it back in park and it died upon shifting it back into park. So there it sits and remains until I can figure out what the issue. Any help would be extremely appreciative. Thank you for reading. Did not intend for this to be so long but  figured better details  greater chances of success hidden within them.3

That could be a problem with the idle air control. Shifting from P to D puts extra load on the engine  so the idle rpm has to increase correspondingly otherwise the engine will stall. If you have the 4.3L engine  the IAC valve can get confused if the battery is disconnected  so that could be the problem. If so  an idle-learn procedure is required. The valve’s position and operation can be tested using a scan tool. On a 96 it might just need a good cleaning. It may be stuck due to gunk.

5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,2,VDCdriver,If an independent mechanic (as opposed to a dealership) is charging that much  it damn well better include a timing belt! Even at a dealership  a 60k/120k major service (which includes EVERYTHING except a timing belt) usually runs somewhere in the area of $350.–$400.ADDENDUM: I would recommend replacing the water pump as well as the timing belt. Hopefully that incredibly inflated price includes both procedures.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,3,riggyrow,The major service at 30/60/90/120K miles runs about $550 for an Outback at the dealership. This includes an “inspection” of the fuel systems  lines and connections  but not actually “servicing” them. For the most part  this major service includes spark plug and air filter replacement  coolant drain and refill  changing the break fluid  and rotating the tires. Everything else is just “inspected.” $620 for a major tune-up from an indy mechanic seems unreasonably high  unless he is including the timing belt–which I highly doubt since he would have mentioned it otherwise. Maybe he’s planning on taking care of some previously neglected items that wouldn’t normally be included in a tune-up? I would probably shop around for a different mechanic.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,4,VDCdriver,The dealership that I use charges somewhere in the $350.–$400. range  and in addition to the items that you mentioned  that includes a transmission fluid change  an oil change  changing the fuel filter  servicing the differential and cleaning the injectors. My dealer is beginning to sound better and better.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,5,pleasedodgevan,I would change the plugs  run it til it dies and get another car after that. I really wouldn’t  but the question I have is: How long do you want to run that thing? Or  better. How much are you trying to save here  and is it worth it to keep the old thing going? It could be worth it to you but maybe not to someone else. I would save most of that money for maintenance after the head gaskets blow out  or use it for a newer car when the big failure happens. You should be operating in worry-free territory here. Your money skills are admirable so I think you will come to the right conclusion.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,6,mcparadise,There really is no such thing as a “tune up” anymore  since the car’s computer “tunes” the engine as you drive. New plugs and wires  and maybe an oil and filter change  is about it. I’d like to know what this expensive mechanic is going to “tune.”You need a new timing belt  and if the belt is included in the price quoted  the price is OK. Otherwise it’s outrageously expensive.Ask for a detailed list of what will be done during this “tune up.”By the way  skip the fuel injection service. It’s unnecessary and worthless. Gasoline has fuel system detergents in it  and that’s all you need.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,7,jillvt,Thank you so much for all of your replies  you have no idea how helpful it is!! I just came back from the mechanic  and I asked for a detailed list of what the tune-up includes. It does NOT include a timing belt. It is an “electronic tune up” - new spark plugs  air filter  PCV valve  fuel filter  distributor cap and ignition rotor  and also has a fuel injection service. I will call some dealerships. I’m curious how necessary much of this is? I just had the front brakes done and a transmission service. Since it’s getting close to 60 000 miles since the engine was replaced  so is it time for a timing belt?
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,8,ok4450,I pretty much agree with the electronic tune-up part of this  although the words “tune up” are not really appropriate anymore. Rather than cap/rotor replacement  I would examine them for burning or carbon tracking. If there is none  they can be re-used  but I would replace the plug wires if they’re the originals.Mileage is not the only factor in timing belt replacement; time is an issue also. Rubber dry rots and a belt that is 5 years or so old has a chance of breaking no matter the mileage.One area that should be examined when a “complete” tune up (bad words again) is done is valve lash adjustment. Depending on the engine you have some models have mechanical lifters and a regular inspection and adjustment should be performed  although Subaru  Honda  Toyota  etc make recommendations of a 100k miles on this. Pure bunk IMHO. They’re not the ones having to pay for damaged cylinder heads due to lash problems.If you’re not familiar with which engine you have look at the sticker under the hood. There should be a spec given for “Valve Lash”. It will either give some numbers about Intake/Exhaust clearances or say something to the affect of N/A  with the latter meaning they’re hydraulic lifters and no adj. check is necessary. Hope that helps.
5850,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tune-up-price-for-a-subaru/5850,Tune Up Price for a Subaru,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,9,VDCdriver,If your mechanic is charging $620. for that relatively short list of parts and procedures  I really think that he is trying to take advantage of you. His price is at least $350. more than it should be for that short list of services  and his list omits a lot of things that are recommended by the manufacturer for that mileage interval.Getting less and paying more? I don’t think so!

I left out the oil/filter change  but everything else you mentioned costs extra on top of the $500-$550 that Wilkins Subaru in Glen Burnie  MD charges…They sack you for an extra $150 for the transmission service alone.

Some advice from old geezers (or young punks) who have not gone “along with the times ” may not be the best.Pumping the accelerator while starting a car or revving the engine while turning it off are a couple more examples that go along with advice about using heavy weight oil (much higher than manufacturer recommended) for aging cars.Sometimes “if a little is good then a lot is better ” isn’t better.CSA
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,22,Rod_Knox,Racing engines were built quite loose with much greater clearance on bearings  pistons  etc.  and used heavy oils and high volume pumps to keep everything together. Somewhere the 20W-50 “racing” oil got popular with wannabe hot rodders and those who thought that racing oil must be better than just plain oil. Well  that’s how it appeared to happen down south. And in warm weather the heavy oil didn’t seem to make much difference especially in big American V-8s.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,23,Triedaq,Let me add a couple other thoughts on using heavier or lighter oil than specified. I have a 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass with the 260 cubic inch V-8 engine that I purchased new. The owner’s manual specified either 10W-30 or 10W-40 oil. I believed that the 10W-40 offered better protection  so that is what I used. However  I kept having problems with carbon build-up and pre-ignition (engine ping). I would pour one can of Casite Motor Tune-up in the gas tank and feed another can of Casite through the carburetor and then run the car up to a highway speed in 2nd to burn out the carbon. I had to do this treatment about 3 times a year. Someone called into CarTalk with a similar problem. Tom and Ray suggested that the 10W-40 oil might be the problem. I switched my Oldsmobile to 10W-30 and my carbon build-up problem disappeared. Apparently the polymers that increased the viscosity range in certain brands of 10W-40 casued the problem. On older 1 cylinder air cooled lawn mower engines  30 weight was specified. I know of a couple instances where a person reasoned that 10W-30 oil should be the same  used the 10W-30 and the connecting rod bearing let go. I think that a 5W-30 synthetic oil might be o.k. in these engines  but I’ll stick with the straight weight 30. I have had the mower since 1988 and had no problems.

Just use the recommended weight. Lots of places hotter than Florida (engines don’t care about humidity)  all should use what’s recommended.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,28,Bing,Gee  I can’t believe I missed this one seven years ago. Musta been busy. I’ll defer to experts but the question I have is how does the engine know it’s 100 degrees in Florida or only 70 degrees in Iowa? The engine starts cold at about the ambient temperature which may be anywhere from 10 below to 100 above. Then it warms up to operating temperature of 220 or so. It will continue to run at that 220 temperature until shut down. So what difference does it make if it is 100 degrees out or not? The engine is running at 220. Now with coolant in hotter temps  there can be a reduction in the ability to cool the antifreeze a little in hotter weather but still are only talking about an additional temp of maybe 20 degrees unless the engine fries at 280.So yeah  use what the book says regardless of what they do in Mexico.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,29,ken2116,Some one mentioned this earlier  the coolant temperature doesn’t control the oil temperature - the oil depends on air flow over the pan for some of it’s cooling so on a day when the air near the pavement is 120F it oil will run hotter than a day when it’s cooler.We’ve followed the mfgrs oil recommendations for decades with several cars having tight engines beyond 220 000mi.  no oil consumption or lubrication issues  using quality conventional oil changed at 4000-5000mi. (Synthetic used where required). A car that obviously is heavily worn might be a candidate for heavier oil  but there could be trade-offs with how well the oil pump can deliver it and how it performs in hydraulically operated components.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,30,Purebred,Well  now that this thread has been revived yes since I matured in the late 60s  the lower viscosity requirements seem too low but the manufacturers engineers know what they are doing. My F150 4X4 takes 5W-20  that is what it gets. I do change early  at around 20% according to the OLM. The one thing I am not good at is checking the oil level. Though the truck is totally stock  the location of the dipstick makes using a small stepladder a necessity.

It might be acceptable to use 5W20 instead of 0W20 in a consistently warm climate  but it can freeze overnight as far south as Alligator Alley.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,32,Docnick,I have an old EXXON tape called “The Cold War” detailing the problems with very cold starts.They have a Ford Escort with 10W30 mineral oil and start it up in a lab with -35F temperature. After several minutes the engine starts smoking as the thick oil is not reaching the valve gear. Considerable damage was done after several of these cold starts.Those of us who have lived in these regions use block heaters when possible but also go to the widest grade of multi-viscosity oils to both ensure safe starts and good protection once the car is warmed up.This EXXON tape then showed their 0W30 synthetic under the same conditions with the same car. No problems here.
66918,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-weights-and-florida-hot-weather/66918,Oil weights and Florida hot weather,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusionhybrid||ford||,33,Rod_Knox,I’m curious re the smoking due to the thick oil not reaching the valve gear. I Googled EXXON Cold War and didn’t find anything. Escort engines had hydraulic lifters and if the oil was too cold to pump several lifters would be stuck fully extended while others would be lacking oil and clattering and if smoking it would seem to be friction on the bearings or on the cam lobe to follower interface.No doubt -35* F is off the charts for me though. My record low dealing with cars was -2*F and most people were lucky their engines wouldn’t start considering the damage done to some that did.

Prior to that Shell had introduced their “Syn-arctic” which was a synthetic blend with a pour point of -50C. We’re going back to the 70s here. That was before Mobil1. The smoking in the experment was likely camshaft bearings not getting oil. Many other parts would not be getting oil either.In today’s engines most have the valve gear actuated and adjusted by hydraulic pressure form the engine oil and the oil flowing properly is doubly importantIf you are in doubt about any oil  check the pour point and the “Borderline Pumping Temperature”. Then compare with your lowest expected temperature. Our lowest last winter was about -36F.We have an electrically heated bird bath in our yard. It’s made in Minnesota and performed well for 5 winters now!We often spend time in a mountain lodge in the winter. Many have no outlets for block heaters. On a cold morning it can be soo cold that the car door locks don’t work and the gear shift is only moved with difficulty…

On one hand  you gotta get to work or you cannot afford to fix it. I threw stop leak in my old Volvo to get by for a couple more years. I found some product partially blocking water ports in the head when I finally tore it down  but it did not cause any problem  and that high mileage Volvo engine was not worth much anyway. On the other hand  I have seen some bad stuff happen in MB water jackets that had been abused or neglected  and a Benz engine with 130k is still worth some money.Where is the leak? If it is degrading plastic around the upper radiator hose  it will continue to degrade and Bar’s Leak won’t stop it. Similarly  if it is the O-ring seal between the aluminum core and the plastic end caps that is leaking due to being attacked by the wrong anti-freeze  then Bar’s Leak probably won’t help that either because of the movement as the aluminum expands and contracts more than the plastic.

For what it’s worth  listening to advice about modern engines based on information that is five  ten or 20 years old is asking for trouble.

Honda does recommend you keep the original oil to whatever the oil life moniter states. They have special additives they apply to certain components of engine during manufacture to help with break in. You basically drained them out.

Read your owner’s manual more carefully. Most manuals list several options – a preferred weight and one or more alternatives that are perfectly acceptable. Often they factor in the owner’s climate.Considering that you live in Phoenix  5W-30 might even be the weight that Honda recommends for you.

If so  maybe he has been instructed to push 5W-30 oil because the service department buys it in bulk. On our 2003 Toyota 4Runner  the manual calls for 5W-30 but said that 10W-30 could be used  but should be replaced with 5W-30 at the next oil change. The service department at the dealership put in 10W-30 when he changed the oil. The 4Runner was on warranty at the time. However  I had my trusted independent do the next oil change and that dealer never saw me again. We did get a new Toyota dealer from whom I bought a 2011 Sienna. The service department is very strict about following the recommendations in the owner’s manual and use the specified synthetic 0W-20 at each oil change.

The oil I had put in was Shell synthetic blend 5w30. The shop owner that did the oil change says that the protection from the 5w30 is equivalent to the 0w20.What are the special chemicals used for the break in oil?

73889,https://community.cartalk.com/t/is-5w30-ok-to-use-on-a-new-crv/73889,Is 5w30 ok to use on a new CRV?,Maintenance/Repairs,||cr-v||honda||,13,Bing,In addition to that statement in the owners manual will be a chart or wording telling you the viscosity to use. I’m quite sure it will say 0-20 like our Acura now does. 0-20 is only available in a full synthetic that I have found not a synthetic blend like you put in. They won’t tell you to use a synthetic specifically but you can’t get a 0-20 in non-synthetic or a blend as far as I have determined.Whether it is in Arizona or Minnesota  the summer oil temp when it is cold is going to be fairly close such as 70-80 degrees. The 0-20 has a cold viscosity of 0  whereas the 5-30 has a heavier cold viscosity of 5. Using a 5 instead of a 0 on a cold start whether in Minnesota or Arizona will be too heavy to provide proper lubrication. When it warms up to operating temperature  like 200 degrees  the 20 oil will be thinner and provide the necessary lubrication to the tight tolerances in the engine. The 30 is a heavier oil again. Does it ever get to 200 degrees outside in Arizona? If not the whole arguement for using 30 vs 20 is academic. (I understand this is not totally correct to an engineer but close enough for a normal car owner.)While they do have special break-in additives  there is no way still I would keep the original oil in beyond 5000 miles but did consult with the dealer on that. They agreed it was fine to change it at the first 5000 miles with no problem. Changing it before that though might not be advised.So at any rate  re-read the manual and look for the specific viscosity of the oil recommended. If its 0-20  switch to full synthetic and get the 5-30 out of there Just IMHO of course  but anyone else get 530 000 on an original engine? Now I need to talk to my son about changing oil more often than once a year in his BMW.

B) while the 5/30 will not do any damage it will cost you a little in MPG… One of the changes they made going form 2011 to 2012 was the oil in the motor and trans are thinner. This along with aero-dynamic changes resulted in a 4+ MPG upswing in 2012 CRV’s… Your Mech probably does not stock 0/20 which is why he used 5/30…

I took the vehicle back to the garage and had them drain and fill it with 0w20 synthetic. I spoke to Shell tech support today and they told me the 2012 engines have smaller oil holes and tighter bearing clearances and need the lighter oils to lubricate properly. The Honda tech support said the same thing. I changed the oil at less than 1000 miles to remove any metal shavings  etc.  from the break in process. I am planning on keeping this vehicle a long time and want the engine to be broken in with no problems.

If I change the oil at 7500 miles  which the Shell engineer told me is ok  then the oil change costs the same as changing every 3000 miles with conventional or synthetic blend oil. The Shell engineer told me the 100% synthetic oils can go 10 000 or even 15 000 because they do not break down or leave deposits like conventional oils.

Walmart has Mobil full synthetic 0-20 for ~$25 for a 5 qt jug. The oil change might be cheaper at the dealer. Granted  mine put Pennzoil in it…Just follow your oil life monitor  just know that it is also due to be changed at one year mark  so if you drive less than 8-10K miles a year  you have to go with the yearly schedule.

In addition  car manufacturers start and run engines (and many even drain the oil and refill after initial starts and testing). I have spoken to numerous service advisers and even some manufacturer techs and all of them have concurred that it is unnecessary to drain the oil before the first normal change interval. As mentioned by others here  many cars come with an oil package meant to assist with break-in and should be left in for the normal oil change interval.The difference between how engines are made now and how tight the tolerances are  compared to engines from 10 or 20 years ago is amazing. Oils and filters are also much more advanced. While some of the “retro-grouches” may not like it  much of this technological advancement has caused most of us to rethink our maintenance. I used to change oil every 3 000 miles without fail. Now I routinely go to 7 500 miles or more. I still change all fluids but I use the extended intervals shown in the owner’s manual since I drive all highway miles. The dealer always tries to encourage me to come in more often but reluctantly admits that it is not really necessary.Incidentally (since I know all the old-timers will react in horror) my vehicles have the following mileages with zero mechanical issues related to fluid changes (oil  trans  coolant  brake  power steering): 199 000; 142 500; 108 500; 3 300 (my new Mazda 3i).

A similar fluid has to be synthetic to achieve the high temperature rating the Honda DOT-3 fluid has. And it cannot be silicone. I use Valvoline DOT 3 and 4 Synthetic Brake Fluid in my 2005 Accord and it works very well.The manual says to use Honda motor oil or anything of the same quality.I would follow the Oil Life Monitor and change the oil when it is between 20% and 10%. I follow the OLM in the 2 cars that have it and I don’t lose oil between changes in either

I use 5W-30 in both of my hondas ('02 CRV and 04 Pilot). Recommended is 5W-20. Both cars have high mileage (out of warranty).

Once a point is hit where they no longer want to shell more money out it is either sold to another owner or junked.Some people the limit is $500 others thousands upon thousands of dollars.While Lexus is a good bet there is no real way of knowing the future.

If you are unhappy with the dealership  consider a second opinion from an independent mechanic. At the very least  a replacement fuel pump would be less expensive at an independent.Ed B.

When I put it in drive I can feel it trying to rev its self a little. The car also doesn’t respond to the gas pedal well I can push it down and it won’t really do anything just keep jerking and I have to push the brakes extremely hard to stop the car! There is not check engine light either! Help please and thank you!I think it’s either the Idle air control or the throttle body but I’m not sure.

I suspect once somebody hooks up a scanner and gets a hold of the wiring diagram for the throttle controls  they’ll figure it out within a reasonable amount of timeIf you aren’t able to somehow fix it on your own  have it towed to a shop.

Consider the “H-body” GM subcompacts of the mid-late '70s. These cars (Chevy Monza  Pontiac Sunbird  Olds Starfire  and Buick Skyhawk) usually needed to have their brakes relined every 15-20k miles because the brakes were so under-sized.However  I have not seen any evidence that the Altima suffers from that type of design problem  so the OP’s situation is almost surely a reflection of where she drives  and how she drives.

Does that mean anything  and if those results are expected from a brand new battery  how likely can a battery just go bad?BillRussell - the charger is 2 (might be rounded) amps. There’s a port for 5 amps  but nothing is plugged into that one - that’s for ‘fast charging’ whatever  not the iPhone though.shadowfax - I meant that nothing was manually turned on  and if it could be manually turned off  then it was. I realize a car is not a battery pack; the manual does state a couple times about the ports and accessory power socket being used to charge devices  so this car (as I’m sure with others) was designed with this in mind. I’ll have to check that radar emitter thing  good idea! As to a slow head unit  if I click the Audio button to display the currently playing station  it’ll take several seconds. If I click the settings button  it’ll take a few more seconds. Sometimes it’ll take maybe up to 15 seconds for a screen to come up  but usually it’s a few seconds - to me that feels sluggish  even slow compared to trying a Samsung Galaxy 6 on it (3 or 4 year old phone). Ha  sorry about that natural sounds thing - you know when you turn on a TV  you’ll hear a little pop or electrical crackle? Or when you flip some light switches  usually older ones  you’ll hear a little pop of electricity starting to flow? That’s what I’m referring to  those seemingly normal electrical sounds when something turns on or off  I hear that often with ACC and maybe it’s just be now noticing it  but it seems louder than it should  chalk on a chalkboard after a while.jtsanders - I’ve heard the same about the Honda and the car putting on the brakes  but with no human explanation a couple times now  and the harsh deceleration it did  yeah i think it needs a lot of work.thegreendrag0n - thanks for the test idea. Maybe i can do that at Auto Zone this weekend since they have the equipment and it’s free. Any other test ideas? as for questions: #1 it’s about 20 miles and about 1 hour  car sat in the parking lot for about 7 hours afterwards when it was then used to charge the phone. #2 the car was purchased with minimal miles about March of this year. The dealer kept it for several days afterwards to do the interior lighting. Do you think this is still possible  even a few months after they did that install and a month before the incident  their battery test shows “battery good”.whitey- good point. i thought about calling places  honda or dealerships  and ask point blank some of these questions  but i’m not sure i’d fully trust whatever answers i get  they have their business interests in mind.

If they act the same way  probably nothing you can do about any of this  other than turning off the automated features you don’t like. I expect the ‘struggling’ sound is just the way your CV Transmission works. I have a friend who bought a 2018 Corolla  and it has that sound when accelerating. If you have a turbo engine  that could contribute to that sort of sound also. The only thing you’ve mentioned that’s sort of surprising to me is that the battery discharged to the point the engine wouldn’t crank after 45 minutes charging your cell phone with the engine off. I can’t see how that could be explained away as “being normal”. Suggest to show the dealership exactly what you did that made that happen. They may be able to see what’s going wrong just by you showing them. Also you could ask that you try recharging your cell phone in one of their lot cars  see if that causes the battery to go dead.BTW  suggest to avoid getting your car jump started if at all possible. It can confuse and even damage the computers.

So things like that  bummer it sucks and i don’t like it  but at least i know it’s not just my car. Not all auto features can be turned off  either  that was my first reaction as well. As for showing the dealership  I intend to the best I can  but keeping them focused on my car alone and for however long to monitor things or drive on the roads with me until some things happen  well that i’m not so sure they’d be willing to do for long periods of time.

If they tell you  “Nothing can be done …” the answer is “Fine  put it in writing.” And also make notes of every time something you feel is weird happens. If you are technologically sophisticated  record your conversations and scan your receipts  and record your reports as they happen  but be sure that you make a solid record. Honda will respond if they have to  and with your notes that will be the situation.

My car has a manual transmission  so I can usually push start it if absolutely necessary. I had my alternator damaged one time when giving a jump start to another car  so I don’t do provide jump starts either  unless there’s some sort of hazardous situation involved.I presume ACC means automatic cruise control  which involves the car’s radar collusion avoidance system. My friend with the 2018 Corolla has that function  and said it sometimes makes a buzzing alarm sound for no apparent reason. I think that’s just something you have to accept if you decide to leave it turned on.

I have no idea what they did or how they did it so… Maybe these accessories can be disconnected as a test procedure to see what happens?You might not consider finding another dealer to be a good option. Since this was dealer installed accessories this means that…Honda Motor Company will not warranty any problems related to this. The dealer might  or should.This means another dealer will charge you quite likely a 100 bucks an hour to sort out whatever has been done involving those accessories. Five hours X 100 bucks adds up quick  etc and you have to remember that they may be going in blind.

Remain on good terms with the dealership. But if they simply offer no hope  in the back of your owner’s manual you should find the contact info for Honda Corporation. When you contact them  they’ll tell you how to proceed to get the issues resolved.

At any rate the guy was trying a new car out with the new brake system  out in the middle of no where in Wyoming or someplace. On the Interstate  no one around and all of a sudden the car slammed on the brakes and came to a screeching halt. Whatever it saw it didn’t like but the sense then was the system was not ready for prime time. All of this fancy stuff put on cars now to help distracted drivers may not be the answer yet and I would not use it. I do like blind spot monitors but really this stuff should only be supplemental. Yeah batteries can go dead pretty quickly and I don’t think the standard batteries are all that powerful anyway.

If they say “no problem  have your car jump started anytime you like”  then if it damages something  they’ll be responsible to take care of it. So that won’t be an issue while the warranty remains in effect. ] Better idea: Read the manual. If it doesn’t say not to jump start the car  and does have instructions on how to jump start the car  then it’s on them if jump starting inherently damages the car.Asking the dealership requires 1) whoever you talk to knows what he’s talking about  and since it will probably be a service advisor at best and a salesman at worst  that’s a big leap  and 2) that the dealership is honest.Ask them if something’s gonna damage your car  they say no  you do it  damage the car  and then… You think they’ll just own up to what they told you? “No man  I never said that. Never even saw this guy. No idea what he’s talking about.”

It’s not a sensitivity setting as was suggested somewhere  according to the manual. But crossing fingers it’ll keep up.I forget if one of the things I was recently finding is the “BRAKE” beep sound without the visual and for no discernible reason. I found a setting on the car that states whenever a car gets into “sight”  it’ll give that beep. I don’t know how or why that setting suddenly changed  and I didn’t see the pattern of that beep with the usual car icon on the dash  but changing the setting has gotten rid of that beep.George and shadowfax  the manual talks about how to jump a battery  connecting the positive first and negative second  etc.  but doesn’t state doing so is at my own risk or voids warranties or anything. And since they describe how to jump it tells me jumping is acceptable. Shadowfax  I agree with the asking the dealership  both of which requires me to trust their answer  which is what brought me here in the first place - I’m confident they know what they’re doing  and for business reasons trying to keep their costs in check  and sometimes that means saying things to appease customers opposed to trying to find elusive problems.greendrag0n (and all)  i still want to set aside an afternoon to do many tests  including now that the USB charger i had in the accessory slot doesn’t work and wondering if that was faulty.I’ll try to keep posted here  in case others run into similar snags or questions… thanks for everyone’s input!

Noting that I would never do this to hold off the deluge of know-it-all postings  I am unfamiliar with using goop. The question is  since it seems to be holding  whether it should be taken in to have the nail pulled and a plug put in  or leave well enough alone. ??10

124413,https://community.cartalk.com/t/tire-goop-now-10-characters/124413,Tire goop (now 10 characters),Maintenance/Repairs,||explorer||ford||,5,keith,The goop is water based (latex) and if left in will rot the tire and cause massive corrosion to the rim. The tire not only has to be patched from the inside  it also must be allowed time to completely dry. This is one time I’d recommend filling the tire with nitrogen after the repair as the nitrogen is dry and will absorb any remaining moisture.

More often than plugging leaks it didn’t and it fouled the adhesive of the patch; I had to discard the tube.It’s easy to plug an auto tire with inexpensive patches. They’ve held well for years (though not forever) for me. If plugs for auto tires work the way plugs for bicycle tires do  goop will foul the adhesive  it won’t stick. I might try it but be prepared for it to fail immediately. A real repair  which would include cleaning out the tire  is probably the best solution.If the tire has been inflated with that canned stuff (e.g.  Fix-a-flat) it has flammable gas in it. Be sure to warn the tire-person.

I carry aerosol cans of puncture seal to use if needed in an emergency but it would only be used if/when there were no other reasonable alternative. And once back home I would get the tire properly repaired and pay the significant charge for cleaning the tire and rim and replacing the monitor if needed. I strongly suggest that @melott gets the tire professionally repaired before getting too far from home.

The other problem is it might have an adverse effect on the tire pressure sensor. If I had a car w/no tire pressure sensors and no vibration felt after the goop method  I’d just leave it that way until the next time I had to separate the tire from the rim.

That was my point. To clean it out requires unmounting  which requires special tools. The person who has those tools wouldn’t ask this question; the person who would probably won’t buy them for 1 or a few applications.

The battery light has been flashing occasionally as well in the past couple months. I havent paid any attention because it happens now and then and it flickers a couple of times and goes away and I don’t see it all the time. Some say it’s either the battery  or the alternator. I did replace the alternator approximately 3 - 4 years ago. The battery is apx 2 1/2 years old but in the AZ desert heat battery go FAST!

Very much appreciated… I kept pressing on and found several other people experiencing the same issue. Was also told that it could be the alternator  and /or the battery.I do recall seen the battery light flicker on occasion “very dimly” recently but none the less it was flickering. Which goes with the alternator theory. But not to rule out the sugested you mentioned.I’m a little distrote to the fact it only happens when accelerating going up the mountains. If I go into overdrive several times while climbing “It happens”!I’m going to go to Auto Zone to have tests on the alternator and battery.

Many people… because their car is so quiet…think that the engine was still running and they only lost power steering. You may be able to verify this if you have a tachometer. When all the warning lights come the engine is in fact not running  and as @Nevada_545 mentioned  it is likely that you have a bad/loose battery terminal.Yosemite

Try driving with just a single key in the ignition switch  see if that makes any difference. Sometimes a dangling keychain can damage the ignition switch. Also try pressing on the battery cables in various directions  see if that causes the problem.

If you know you have an electrical issue with your power steering but don’t have a code reader or scan device  it may take some time to find the root of the problem. Examine your fuse box  look for obvious faults with your wires and connections  and check the voltage in your battery. Assuming those actions don’t work  here’s a quick (possible) fix – shut your car off completely and restart it. This helps reset the electrical components  and your electric steering might come back. However  don’t expect this method to offer a long-term solution. Have your electrical steering parts and components examined by a mechanic as soon as possible.

I pull over shut it off wait a min and it starts up right away and is just fine. The main tome that it happens is when I accelerate and go into overdrive. That’s when it happens

I mean  can you see it physically staying in? Or Is it more of a “the button popped back out  but radio is still seeking?” If the button is physically stuck  you can try a little bit of silicone spray to see if it unsticks. Soda or coffee may have gotten in there and gummed it up a bit.honestly  either way it may just be time for a new radio.

On some radios  this will start a reboot sequence. If you have a CD and the above doesn’t work  repeat but holding down the CD eject button instead.

I have a 2009 Pontiac Vibe GT. It’s got a Monsoon subwoofer  my radio volume knob broke and now I just sit in silence. Anyone of you fellows know what all i need to install a kenwood double din stereo. The model number for the stereo is a DNX570HD. I had this radio in my old 2008 Chevy cobalt. So I have the old harnesses from that car. I took the old manufactured radio out to see if the harnesses were the same and some were. Only difference is the Pontiac has a volume button on the steering wheel that I’d like to keep using if it works. So the installation kit  harnesses and whatever else I may need to get the sub to still work. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Also  I want to do it on my own if possible. Do I have to mess with the battery or plug anything into fuse boxes? Thanks!!5

Look them up on the web.They have tons of adapter cable sets to do exactly what you want. That is IF the Kenwood unit will accept the signals from the steering wheel and can send the proper signals to the sub. A careful read of the Kenwood manual will explain if that is possible.

Thank you guys so much! I’m pretty sure the wiring harness from my 08 cobalt will fit my 09 vibe. When I took out the old radio I checked the ends and made sure they fit. I checked out crutchfield and they have the installation kit. And it comes with instructions on how to remove the old radio!

The Vibe is essentially a Toyota Matirix; a Corolla wagon. The Cobalt is not a Toyota. Your harness might work  but make sure before you pull the Cobalt harness.

The ones that were not aligned took more weight to balance. When I drive at 40mph up to 60mph I get a shake at the steering wheel. Yesterday I switched the front tires to the back and the back tires to the front and the shake/vibration at the steering wheel stopped. Should I go back and have them align the tires so that the red dot is close to the valve stem or are the tires defective? Any recommendations on tire shops that have the road force balancer?

If you are not already doing so  try a shop that specializes in this work  rather than a local mechanic. If you can feel the balance issue at 40 MPH it is not even close to done right.

It could be as simple as weights falling off . I am surprised that a 2013 Camaro even can be bought with steel wheels .
124719,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-chevrolet-camaro-balanced/124719,2013 Chevrolet Camaro - Balanced,Maintenance/Repairs,||chevrolet||,4,It_s_Me,Whenever you see a red spot  match this up with the valve stem unless you happen to have a steel wheel that has a dimple on the exterior side of the rim area. The dimple indicates the wheels’ low spot and is spec’ed by some original equipment manufacturers so that they can match mount tires and wheels installed on new cars at the factory.
124719,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-chevrolet-camaro-balanced/124719,2013 Chevrolet Camaro - Balanced,Maintenance/Repairs,||chevrolet||,5,TwinTurbo,You’ll likely find varying opinions on the markings. My Yokohamas have two dots; yellow and red. The yellow dot denotes heaviest point of the tire and red is lightest point. Using the correct dot (if supplied) ensures the least amount of counterbalance weight can be used. One or the other should be lined up with the stem depending on the rim. It would irk me if they paid no attention to it. I’d go back because if they didn’t pay any attention to it  better chance they paid less attention to achieving a decent balance either…Edit  ItsMe responded while I was typing. He’s right about the dimple so check that as well.
124719,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-chevrolet-camaro-balanced/124719,2013 Chevrolet Camaro - Balanced,Maintenance/Repairs,||chevrolet||,6,Mustangman,Lemme throw one out at you. Are there weights only on the inside of the wheel? Or are there weights both inside and outside on at least 2 of the wheels? Some tire guys think they are “doing you a favor” by not putting weights on the outside because it looks better. The wheels are only statically balanced that way and for a smooth ride they need to be dynamically balanced.I would worry less about the dots and more that the guy doing the balancing can’t do the job. I live on the other side of Florida and have the same problem finding a competent tire shop.

The first time I had ever seen 4 snow tires on a car. He constantly bragged about the gas mileage on his car. He claimed it got in the mid 20s. Very few cars in 1958 would do that and certainly not a Y block Ford V8.We got tired of listening to it and decided to do something about it. We started adding gas to his car. Only a gallon at a time at first. increasing slowly to 5 gallons a week.He was ecstatic! His mileage kept getting better and better.And then we started siphoning gas back out! We quit when we had taken out everything we had put in.We never heard about his mileage again.

I let it coast towards red lights and switch off the engine while waiting for trains to go by at railroad crossings. Keeping it under 55 not only puts it in its gas mileage sweet spot  but also dramatically extends rear tire life.

He claimed that it took him only 30 minutes to drive from his home to his place of employment. The problem with his claim was that he also proudly proclaimed that he never drove his Rambler American more than 40 mph  and that he never used toll roads.His daily commute was approximately 35 miles  and it might have been possible to do it in 30 minutes if he used the Garden State Parkway  and if he didn’t drive like Grandma. However  he used a very indirect route–with lots of traffic lights!–in order to avoid toll roads  and his actual drive time was probably something more like 55 minutes–on a good day.Why do people lie in such an obvious manner?

People are really  really good at fooling themselves. Maybe he made a math error calculating mpg’s on one fillup  and every subsequent calculation was “an aberration.”It’s the same kind of thing that leads people to believe magic potions like essential oils work – they get sick  use an essential oil  and feel better  and therefore magic potions are real. They’re not lying  but they fail to consider the idea that they would probably have started feeling better even if they didn’t use the magic potion  and the next time they get sick they’re unwilling to be scientific about it and abstain from the magic potion to see if they get better. And if they take the magic potion and don’t get better  they assume they had a different illness than they thought  and used the wrong magic potion - it can’t possibly be that they were wrong all along and that magic potions only work in fiction.So you have a bunch of people running around saying that magic potions work  and they aren’t lying because they actually believe it  but they are completely deluded.

Of course  considering the traffic situation on I-35 south of Austin Tx  there are times when you wish you could use SECOND gear. The alternative roads not only allow me to travel at a gas mileage friendly speed  they are also more reliable  I never get to work really early  but I’m also never really late. Also  the alternative non-freeway route is a couple of miles shorter distance wise.

It’s not hard to find people who think they average 70 mph on the highway. It’s not impossible to average 70 mph  but in order to do so  you have to be driving 80-90 mph most of the distance. There’s a big difference between going 70 mph and actually being 70 miles away from here one hour from now.I measure my gas mileage by dividing the miles driven by the gas added to the tank  reset my trip odometer after every fillup. If I get 40+ mpg for a dozen fillups in a row  I’m probably actually getting 40+ mpg. When I owned a '91 Geo metro  no trip odometer  I logged the gas I bought and the odometer readings in a log book every time I filled up. Logging the total gas I bought for an entire year and dividing it into the miles I drove for that entire year resulted in 52 mpg. When I say my motorcycle gets 70 + mpg  I mean tank after tank  not once in a row.

The normal MPG for these cars on the highway was 27 MPG. Over 5 years time that was the best it ever got.I also spent a lot of time over those years wrestling the Hitachi carburetor which was half junk when new and pure junk after a few years. They had a LOT of issues with warpage of the body sections. rough idle  hard starts at time  and so .I lost my temper one day and decided to make a change. I made an adapter plate and put a one barrel carb from a Ford 200 C.I. 6 cylinder on it.  Amazing. Instant start hot and cold  smooth idle  etc. My gut feeling was that the fuel mileage would go lower because of the carb. A month later I made a road trip to Tulsa and checked the mileage with the miles driven divided by gallons to fill. It got 38 MPG.I thought oh hxxx no. No way can that happen and I thought I was delusional. Over the next year I checked mileage on a number of road trips (including one to Colorado) and it got 36-38 steady as a clock.

[ It does amaze me that you and others would call me a liar. ] We’re not calling you a liar  we’re saying you’re wrong. I  for one  am not assuming malicious intent in your error.Here’s what I think happened: The car was originally rated 67mpg. But that was under the old EPA mpg formula. Once the new formula came out  the same car (same year  same engine  same transmission) was rated at 47mpg (these are both highway mileage).That’s where your mileage drop came in - not because the car was less efficient  but because the EPA realized their previous mpg measurements were too unrealistic - they allowed for high air temperatures during measurements  no accessory use  etc  an absurdly slow average speed (48mph) and no faster than 18 second 0-60 accelerations.If you drive your car like that  and the weather is appropriately warm  and you aren’t going up hills/etc  I can see you getting close to 70mpg in that car  but you’re also infuriating everyone behind you by going boulevard speeds on 70mph highways.If you drive your car like a normal person  you’re very unlikely to see those numbers on a consistent basis.

I do see something unusual just to the left of the top main bearing bolt  is that what they mean?I think if I had this problem I’d ask them to replace the oil pump  do a performance and compression test  and if that all turned out ok  then keep sieving the used engine oil for metal debris going forward. If nothing appears  and there’s no compression or performance problems I’d say whatever was interfering has ground itself off already  and the issue is resolved. A good argument can be made for just replacing the engine. But doing that introduces a lot of variables you don’t have now  and as an owner I’d want to avoid those if at all possible. imo the best solution is to keep the original engine that was installed at the Ford factory if at all possible.

The dealer did more than just an oil change  they at least removed the oil pan or you would not have those pictures.I doubt that you spoke directly to the mechanic that worked on your engine but to a service advisor instead. Service advisors may or may not  usually not  have some mechanical knowledge.My guess is that there was some flashing that didn’t get removed from the block that the crankshaft or rod caps hit and created the shavings. Most if not all shavings stayed in the oil pan because they could not go through the pickup screen and they are heavier than the oil so they would settle in the bottom of the pan.The mechanic would have removed any remaining flashing and cleaned the oil pan removing any more shavings. Then he would have put it back together and put in fresh oil.Any shavings that would have gotten through the pick up screen would not likely damage the oil pump because they are a soft metal and the oil pump has large clearances in it. They would then go straight to the oil filter where they would definitely get trapped  so the rest of your engine is protected.You have sufficient documentation that there was a factory defect  keep it just in case.

On the other hand if Ford recognizes that the OP’s situation is just the beginning of an onslaught of complaints they will avoid rushing into a complete replacement in hopes of downplaying the situation and avoiding the expense of replacing possibly thousands of engines when the vast majority might operate without noticeable problems until out of warranty.Does anyone know what a computerized “problem avoidance” program would see as the best solution in such a situation?

But the situation with the OP being blown off by the dealer and FMC in the face of such an obvious problem with the new engine really leaves me questioning Ford’s position in honoring their warranty on any claim. The only justifiable reason for declining to replace the engine in such a situation in my opinion is if there is suspicion that the metal was poured into the engine to purposely damage it. Was there possibly some ongoing conflict between the dealership and the OP?

Best take this to a reputable Indie shop. (Look one up on this websites’ list  you’ll probably find one near you.) If a coil is bad  then one of the cylinders is misfiring  or isn’t even firing at all  in any cause  the engine is probably in “limp mode” (Have you noticed a decrease in MPGs  and maybe starts a bit harder?) and that would cause the computer to shut down the anti-lok and traction control (Both systems use the same basic components.) until the problem is fixed.

There are hundreds of error codes. So the place you need to start is by reading the error codes. Many big-box parts stores have “loaner tool” programs and some might have OBD2 code readers in them. You buy the tool  and get a full refund when returned (usually w/in 90 days) Call around and see if you can get your hands on a code reader. Pull your codes and report them.

The number of lights that come on isn’t proportional to the severity of the problem either  could be something fairly simple. If you manually turn the lights off with a code reader say  or disconnect the battery  then they come back on at 1/4 tank  that’s probably just the computer doing its thing. It runs a set of tests after the computer gets reset  and some of them involve transitioning between certain gas tank levels before the test completes. So it may be the test completes  and it failed  so the computer turns the lights one then. Suggest to post the diagnostic codes here  read them out when the lights are on. You might get more help if you post as a new topic.

Turns out the water bypass hose needed to be replaced as I was replacing the coolant I could see it pouring right out onto the street. We replaced the bypass hose and the radiator seems to hold coolant now  but the needle still rides a little high (just under halfway) and if I don’t have the heater on full blast it begins to creep up past the halfway point.I was going to try the thermostat next  but I’m not 100% sure where to go from here. Thoughts?Thanks!12

The temperature gauge  before this incident with the hose always registered about a third of the way up  regardless of driving conditions. Now  it just a hair and the halfway mark and starts climbing without the heat on.I need the car and thought it best not to push it to the red for the sake of testing how bad it would get.Maybe that’s wrong  I just know what it used to do versus what it does now.

There may be an air pocket remaining in there someplace. That can cause this symptom. On my Corolla that’s very easy to do  just drive the front wheels onto ramps  remove the radiator cap and idle the engine until the radiator fan turns on  then replace the radiator cap. The procedure might be more complicated on your car. Pressure testing the cooling system and the radiator cap is worth a try too.

It seems toe be a “feel good” button for people wanting better mpg and show the EPA that Honda is trying. I understand that it stops two of the six pistons from working since four all you need for cruising. But obviously the two pistons still go up and down at the expense of the four that are working. It would be like having a stagecoach with six horses and in cruise mode two horses would not be pulling so the other four would be dragging them along. This would save on feeding the two idle horses but the other four would be worn out plus need more hay. I get better mpg by using fuel with no alcohol. I really like my Pilot since I am also. Just wondering.2
125120,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2017-honda-pilot-eco-assist-system/125120,2017 Honda Pilot eco assist system,Maintenance/Repairs,||pilot||honda||,2,boilerengtn,I think your analogy is a little off. With the eco assist  the two horses wouldn’t be pulling if the wagon was going downhill and you didn’t need them. They’d start again when you reached the next hill. I remember a thread done in the last six weeks with a very similar question on a Honda. One of the responses had a very detailed description about how the eco assist worked. You may want to do a search to find it.I’m curious if you’d see a difference with your normal daily driving - maybe one tank with it on  the next tank with it off. Longer interstate trips don’t offer as many opportunities for mpg improvements.Your main point about the button being more a “feel good” option is mostly right in my opinion. With all the regulations the U.S. has put on fuel economy  many of the big improvements are already incorporated in the design. I wonder if the eco assist could provide much more than a 5% improvement. And I wonder if most of that is the behavior modification for the driver whenever he/she sees the little green plant light on the instrument panel.

I should have said that the two horses were running but not applying any force to pull the coach. I just feel that this is a system that is not worth the cost and possible malfunction. Like the new accords have a small 4 cylinder motor with a turbo which could be problematic. I enjoy reading your columns.

Cracked block and/or heads  head gaskets  lower intake gaskets  etc.Because of your truck’s model year  I believe the inspector does not hook up his tool to check for codesIf the check engine light doesn’t remain on at idle  that part of the inspection should be okayAs for getting it to pass  I suggest driving the heck out of it before heading over to the inspection station. Drive the truck in a lower gear for several miles on the freeway. The idea is to get the catalytic converter REALLY hot  because I suspect it’s in marginal shape  due to age. A hot cat might make the difference between pass and failOnce the cat is hot  but before you head over to the inspection station  make sure there’s no visible smoke coming from the tailpipe at idle. Also rev the engine to make sure no smoke is visible under loadThe inspector is supposed to make sure your idle speed and ignition timing are correct  so make sure that’s okayMake sure the egr works  the inspector is also supposed to check thatMake sure there’s no smoke from the crankcase ventilation system. No visibly split hosesThe inspector is supposed to test your evap system  and he’ll visibly inspect your cap and hook it up to the tester as well. If the cap’s seal is rotten  replace it now.But if your truck is also belching smoke because of a pig rich condition or super high engine oil consumption  there’s no way it’ll pass . . .Good luck  and please let us know what happens

Using this system  available on many of our models including the Mazda6 sedan and CX-5 crossover  you’ll be able to gain entry to your vehicle without ever taking the key out of your pocket. There are “request switches” located at the driver’s  passenger’s  and trunk doors  that you can simply push to gain access while carrying the key. As with the key fob  push twice on the driver’s side door to open all doors.Getting into your Mazda is easier than ever with the multiple keyless entry options available today - learn more about how to use them here.

It has a 3 speed transmission. Up until yesterday morning it ran like a champ. I went and turned it on and it started as normal. I put it in reverse…nothing. didn’t move. Put it in drive  2 1…nothing. I popped the hood and the belt came off. Either it was just a coincidence or what…but I put it back on and it’s still not going in gear. It’s almost like it’s in neutral because the car can be pushed forward and back. In park it stops. It sounds like when I move the gear shift it’s going into gear…but it doesn’t go nowhere. Any suggestions? Side note. I looked at the relay box under the hood and the eatx shutdown relay is missing??? I don’t know if it was ever there or this is part of the problem.1

Check you transmission fluid. Make sure you have enough. Also make sure it has a nice pink color and a somewhat sweet smell. If you do not have enough or it is brown and smells burnt you at a minimum need to refresh your fluid.

Modern side and rear glass are made of tempered glass. If anything breaks the surface of the glass  the whole window shatters into small rounded pieces that won’t cause large cuts. Most of the time you will never know what caused it unless there is more that one instance in a neighborhood at the same time.It can be vandalism  a flaw in the glass or poor installation  or who knows what. Had it happen to my PT Cruiser. I didn’t worry about what caused it  just notified my insurance company and went and had it replaced. I have always carried full glass coverage.

Follow that wire and it probably is moulded into the positive battery cable  where it should still read 14 volts. If not you can purchase a fusible link and splice it into a new wire between the battery and alternator.Yosemite

Often a weak mount will allow the engine to swing and stretch the rubber hose especially at pleats where it can open and the resulting vacuum leak causes the engine to stall due to a lean mixture. And if the throttle body was recently cleaned there is the possibility that the supply hose was not properly installed and a weak mount could be causing a vacuum leak at the connection.Any air that enters the throttle body that bypasses the air flow sensor will result in the ECU failing to send enough fuel to the engine.

A new engine? A rebuilt engine? Or a used engine? [ But it’s burning oil fast ] That is not acceptable. [ I spoke to the manager who replaced it he said that some cars just burn oil faster and to keep adding more when it runs low ] He is lying to you. People replace engines BECAUSE they are burning oil! Check your oil every time you get gas  keep a notebook on mileage when you gas up and how much oil you put in at each fill-up. Oil consumption on a NEW or REBUILT will be higher at first but will drop over 2-3000 miles. The oil consumption should be less than a quart every 1500 miles or so.Gather up all your paperwork and read what the warranty the shop gave you on their work says. Send a registered letter  receipt requested (go to the post office for this) to the manager you talked to. Inform him that you believe the oil burning you experience is not acceptable nor normal for this engine and request the shop solve the problem. Tell him if this is not remedied to your satisfaction you will contact a lawyer. You need to collect proof that you contacted the shop with your concerns BEFORE the warranty on the work runs out if you have any hope of resolution.You paid for a repair  you deserve an engine that doesn’t burn oil. Good Luck

Car keeps dying!,Maintenance/Repairs,||venture||chevrolet||,8,TRB1970,I hear what your saying about the bad connection on the ground or the starter but would it be off and on like that? Would that keep my battery from charging. Because last time it died after a couple of minutes i checked the battery and it had a full charge. I dont know why I took the alternator out. I just didnt know what else to try. Now Im thinking its one of my wires so first Im going to take off all the nuts I can find that secure the battery cables  make sure theyre not corroded and make sure theyre tightened down good. then if that still dont work Ill get new cables.

Car keeps dying!,Maintenance/Repairs,||venture||chevrolet||,11,TRB1970,well I went and put the alternator back in and took the covers off of the battery cable connectors hoping it was just them keeping it from working. I had a plan that if it started I’d drive a block down the road to a publix parking lot so the apartment complex people wouldnt have it towed. So it started right up and just as i pulled into the publix parking lot it died. I turned the key just to see what it would do and it did nothing at all. No dash lights no crank  no buzzer when i put the key in  so the connection at the battery terminals isnt the problem. Ill go by after work tomorrow and try something else. Any other ideas? I still need to finish narrowing down the rest of the connections and wires but it was dark by the time i did this. Thanks again!

103963,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-alternator-good-car-keeps-dying/103963,Battery/alternator good. Car keeps dying!,Maintenance/Repairs,||venture||chevrolet||,17,Cougar,Whenever you have problems like this you should first clean the battery cable connections and battery posts with a battery post cleaning brush. If that doesn’t help then you need to check the wiring from the battery to the fuse panel under the hood. Power from the battery ties to that panel and from there power is supplied to the ignition switch  which then provides power to most of the electrical devices of the car when the switch is turned on. If power is getting interrupted somehow to the ignition switch and it is turned on and nothing happens the first thought is that the battery is dead  but it really can be fully charged. The real problem is within the wire connections between the battery and the ignition switch.

Car keeps dying!,Maintenance/Repairs,||venture||chevrolet||,29,George_San_Jose1,Depending on how the alternator is tested  it could test ok  but still not charge the battery. Some basic voltage measurements at the battery posts is where I’d start. Before the first start of the day  around 12.6 volts. Immediately after starting the engine  at idle  around 13.5-15.5 volts. Anything outside that range means there’s a battery  alternator  or wiring problem.

On my third attempt  the engine turned over. Exactly 2 weeks (to the day) later  it happened again. The engine did not start until AAA provided a battery jump. I then drove the car to a Toyota dealership where it was given a clean bill of health. No problems were detected in the car. A friend advises me to return the car to my dealership and insist on replacing it with another car. I’m concerned about the possibility of the car being a lemon with the failure to start being a continuing issue. What would be our suggestion of any action I should take?3

No sound  clicking sound  engine tried to turn over but did not catch? Each symptom points to a different problem. Do you keep your phone or other after market electronics plugged in? Are you leaving any lights on? All of these can drain a battery. As @GorehamJ says you are a long way from claiming a lemon and having Toyota take the car back under the lemon law. Toyota has a very good reputation for quality and customer service  but if they cannot duplicate the problem they cannot fix it.

You aren’t yet in a position to pursue a Lemon Law claim  but if you do reach that point (in most states  three failed repair attempts for the same problem)  you must submit your claim to the vehicle manufacturer  NOT to the dealership.As was already stated  be sure to retain all documentation of the attempted repairs.

The 20mA you measured may have been when the stereo is being “good” and not bad. I’d disconnect it  pull the fuse  power it down completely and see if your problem goes away.I’d be willing to bet the locking feature is the default for this car and your owners manual can tell you how to change that.It is possible but if that was a problem  you’d see it in the current draw.

Renault’s abysmal quality–coupled with a parts supply chain that sometime took MONTHS to import necessary repair parts–caused the US public to not buy those cars  and by the late '70s  Renault had no choice but to depart from the US marketplace.Then  in the '80s  as American Motors was hovering near death  Renault came to their rescue (?)  and AMC began selling poorly-disguised Renaults under the AMC trademark. The problem for the buyers who were hoodwinked into buying these AMC products was that  no matter what logo appeared on the body  those cars had the traditional Renault reliability–namely very poor reliability. By the end of that decade  Renault again bailed-out of the US marketplace  and Chrysler bought AMC in order to acquire their Jeep marque.As a result of Renault’s tortured history in The US  very few people in The US have any current knowledge of Renault technology.

In volt mode  probe the battery posts. Should measure about 12.6 volts before first start of the day  then 13.5-15.5 volts immediately after starting the engine (at idle).My guess however is the problem isn’t the battery or the alternator or something draining the battery overnight. Instead it’s a problem with the starter motor circuit. Faulty neutral or clutch safety switch  ignition switch  starter motor solenoid  starter motor  or grounding problem. The best way to determine which of those it is  if any of them  is to use your new meter in volt mode to measure the voltage at both terminals of the starter motor during attempted cranking. Measure from the terminal to the starter case. Both should be at least 10.5 volts during attempted cranking. If they are  and it doesn’t crank the engine  replace the starter motor.

If the radio was draining the battery enough to prevent cranking  it would be more than slightly drained. But I agree it makes sense to try disconnecting the radio’s power source as an experiment. If that solves the problem  then the culprit must involve the radio. But I doubt the radio is the actual problem. OP can let us know what they discover.

How bad could the break be? Usually one of the mounting hole which can be repaired. Even if it broke in two it can be welded back together. The problem with junk yards is that they don’t keep cars very long anymore. There are some that specialize in old cars like French Lake Auto Parts north of Minneapolis and that would be your best bet if someone like Rockauto doesn’t carry one. No idea how many years the same bracket was used.

I was able to make it home. I turned off the engine and tried to start it again and it would crank  but wouldn’t start. I checked the codes with a scanner and it reads P0171 (lean)/P0137 (O2). I removed the air box cover and blocked the intake hole with my hand and had a friend turn the engine over and it started. Once it’s started it runs pretty good (especially at higher RPMs). Would this be a vacuum leak? Maybe a MAF sensor? Thanks.18

Maybe a MAF sensor? ] Could be either. Check for obvious vacuum leak sources  like split hoses or hoses that fell off. A split in the boot between the air cleaner and the MAF could cause this too. Next use a hand held vacuum pump to check vacuum operated devices  especially the brake power booster  for vacuum leaks. You might try just disconnecting the MAF as an experiment. If that makes the engine start or run better  it probably needs to be cleaned or replaced. The p0137 is for a problem with the post-cat o2 sensor  and could be related to an MAF problem  or could be a vacuum or exhaust leak  or a failing cat. When you did that experiment partially obstructing the air intake to get it to start  did it then run fine even at higher speeds and during rapid accelerations? If so  unlikely to be a plugged cat.

Sounds more like some kind of air leak is causing it to run a little lean. That would show up more at idle and slow speed driving than faster speeds and rapid accelerations. One idea  spray a little starter fluid in the air intake area  intake manifold  etc  at idle. If the engine speeds up  there must be an air leak.

That seems unlikely to be involved w/the engine running properly. I’m not sure what you mean by “blinking codes”. If you mean the check engine light is blinking  that usually indicates a severe misfire. Which could be caused by running too lean. pcv system and egr system problem can cause lean operation among other problems.

But the two p codes you mention and the symptoms are consistent with too-lean operation. If you enter p0171 Chrysler into google  you’ll see a link to obdii website  which will give you a list of possibilities why the engine is running lean. Basically it is either too much air getting in  or not enough fuel. Is your code reader able to output fuel trim data? If so  that might be helpful.

A vacuum leak would cause the engine to idle faster  not poor acceleration. There is no mass air flow sensor on your Chrysler.

LTFT 24.2% means the computer is having to inject that much more fuel than it thinks it should based on the MAF in order to satisfy the O2 sensors. One interesting point  10 in Hg is pretty poor vacuum at idle. My cars tend to be in the 17-20 inch Hg at idle. The poor vacuum reading at idle leads toward a vacuum leak of some kind. Or a compression problem. Presuming this data corresponds to warm idle. Nevada’s idea above about the fuel pressure is worth considering too. But that wouldn’t explain the poor intake manifold vacuum.

Due to a faulty MAP. Faulty MAP’s as reported here is pretty rare  but happens occasionally I expect.

So he ordered a pump and filter. If that is the case though  why would the vehicle not have any trouble accelerating. Is the motor just compensating? Perhaps that’s why I get the high 24% Long Trim?

That’s b/c the computer presumes each time it pulses the injector  that will result in a certain (known) amount of gas injected. The amount injected depends on the fuel pressure and the injector spec (in pounds of fuel per hour). The computer knows both of these. But if the fuel pressure is actually below the rated fuel pressure (and 20 pounds is indeed low)  the computer pulses the injector ok but not as much gas gets squirted out as the computer assumes. Then the o2 sensor complains the mixture is too lean (not enough gas in this case  rather than too much air)  so the computer increases the injector pulsing time until the O2 sensor stops complaining. That extra pulsing time corresponds to the 25 % fuel trim number.You pose a good question  why doesn’t this result in poor acceleration? One theory  even with low fuel pressure   as long as the fuel demand isn’t too great  the computer can still compensate for the low fuel pressure by increasing the injector pulse time. At some point it could no longer compensate  but that might occur only at really high acceleration or really fast freeway driving. You might try an experiment  if it is safe to do  see what happens when you really step on the gas while going up a steep hill at freeway speeds.In any event  with low fuel pressure  the computer is having to meter the fuel according to the O2 sensor  rather than the usual way using the throttle position and map sensors  that would affect drivability as the o2 sensor method doesn’t allow a quick dynamic adjustment; for example when you step on the gas pedal it might stall out before it figures out what to do. Starting the engine   likewise might be difficult.Hopefully fixing the fuel pressure will solve all the problems. If not  make sure your shop is aware of the MAP measurement I mentioned above. Best of luck.

The problem with trouble codes is that they can report symptoms rather than the cause of the symptoms.

Yours may be similar. With the ignition on  you can have someone operate the cold-warm knob while you watch the action at the valve near the firewall.It’s one reason I bought the car. I did not like the radiant heat that is always present in cars that have the heater core always getting full flow  and use doors and the fan to reduce or increase the air flow over the hot heater core and into the cabin.

Dopes it control a valve that lets more or less goolant water through the heater box? ] Sorry  I couldn’t find a description of how exactly it works. I expect it is some combination of the flow rate of hot coolant going through the heater core and position of the vent doors. @shanonia 's comments above about trying to observe the coolant flow valve as the knob is turned are a good idea. That would work on both my Corolla and my truck  the valves are clearly visible and what they do is obvious. It’s possible that on your car the valve is an off/on type rather than a proportional flow valve. Or there may be no coolant flow control valve at all  and it is all done with the vent doors. Based on what you say above  my guess this particular problem is a vent door control rather than a coolant control valve problem.

It is my third Tucson and by far the worst. I have had it almost three years  and every time I would take it in  they would say they can’t find anything wrong with it. That is the last car I will ever buy from my dealer. Their service manager admitted to me that they have a problem  but they don’t know how to fix it. The final scare that I had was when I was driving slow through a subdivision looking for an address and the transmission locked up and would not go forward or reverse. This car is junk!! Look it up on Utube  and you will see all the people that are having the same problem. Don’t buy any Hyundai with a duel clutch.11

By registering a complaint with the vehicle mfr during the warranty period  it is entirely possible that the mfr’s regional service supervisor could force the local dealership to repair the problem. And  even if there is no remedy on the menu today  by filing a complaint–IN WRITING  and sent via Certified Mail–the OP is helping to ensure a legal–and free–remedy when the mfr eventually owns-up to this problem.

My wife’s Veloster has one. It doesn’t have the problems the newer ones have  but the programming is stupid. It makes accelerating unpredictable - sometimes it’s normal  and sometimes it’s really sluggish  as though the transmission is starting in 3rd gear or something.I would not buy a DCT from them until they learn how to make one.

When I tried fighting them in court  they used their corporate lawyer power against me.The only person who would tell me anything was one of the mechanics. He gave me his cell phone because he was afraid of having his management see him talk to me directly. He did confirm the defect. To protect his job  I did not use him or his quote in court. Hyundai ran circles around me  in both Lemon Law court and three Small Claims court trials.I learned that lesson the hard way and ended up about $3 500 poorer for it  plus my defective vehicle.

I went to so far as to “out” the issue in my review of the Tucson back then. Many owners have had ongoing issues. Like a handful of notorious modern car problems  this is one the Mfg has struggled to get their arms around. I have recently tested multiple Hyundai vehicles (including a Tucson) with the DCT and have had no issues. I think they fixed it  but it’s hard to tell from a new tester.

I turn the key back  sometimes remove it and try again and the car starts. Sometimes I have to do this more than a few times. It is a moment of panic every morning.

When I took a chemistry course  the only elements were earth  air  fire and water. However  isn’t nitric oxide one of the byproducts of combustion and isn’t it possible that this could chemically change to NH3? If Shell has a nitrogen additive  might this not increase the presence of nitric oxide? As I said  my knowledge of chemistry is pretty rusty  but you are a chemist so you would know if this is possible. I have a 2003 Toyota 4Runner V-6 which is probably the same engine that is in your 2007. I haven’t noticed an ammonia smell  but I rarely use Shell gasoline.
71830,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ammonia-smell-from-exhaust/71830,Ammonia smell from exhaust,Maintenance/Repairs,||4runner||toyota||,8,cigroller,I’m a little worried about a vehicle whose exhaust you can smell while driving the car. If you’re driving around with the windows down you shouldn’t be smelling exhaust. Maybe a little whiff once in a while if you’re sitting at idle and the wind blows the right way. But if you’re getting overpowered by exhaust to the point of putting the windows up you should worry about that first.

If you got some critter liquid on an exhaust manifold or pipe or catalytic converter  when it heats up  you’re going to smell it. Unlikely  but not impossible…

It happened a couple weeks ago  I was standing behind my vehicle and could smell it. I didnt think it was coming from my car nut yesterday I was also standing behind my car and I could smell it so strong. I put my head down near the exhaust and it is definitely coming from there. My husband is a mechanic and I asked him about it and he thinks I’m crazy. I’m going to have him try to smell it today. I don’t use shell gas  just regular gas from whatever gas station has the cheapest price. And its definitely ammonia I smell too.

Pin 2 is 5 volts  pin 3 in sensor ground. Beyond that  diy’er testing is going to be hard to do without access to an o’scope. Your 3.6 L engine has 4 camshafts  2 cam sensors. Each sensor has a corresponding tone ring which is what the sensor detects  so you could remove the sensor & check the tone ring for corrosion  damaged  or gunked up. Checking for damage in the sensor part of wiring harness and connectors makes sense too.
124120,https://community.cartalk.com/t/camshaft-sensor-error-and-alternator/124120,Camshaft Sensor Error and Alternator?,Maintenance/Repairs,||caravan||dodge||,3,Cougar,The trouble is with the wiring to the sensor  not the sensor itself  and very well could be just a loose connection between the sensor and the PCM module. Check the power and ground connections like George_San_Jose1 stated above and if those voltage readings are okay then you need to check the resistance to pin 2  the sensor output lead going to the PCM. All you need is a volt/ohmmeter to make those checks.

Since both the battery and alternator have very recently been replaced  I’m wondering if the problem is something like a loose wire  and if so  how to find it? I took it to my local independent mechanic today and the battery and alternator tested OK and the main electrical wires are also OK. When he started the van and wiggled the ignition key  various instrument lights would go on and off. He suspects that the connectors of the ignition switch wiring harness don’t have a solid connection (corrosion?) and that replacing the wiring harness may solve the problem.Does this make sense or there other possible causes of the problem that I should investigate?I have become concerned about traveling any more than a few minutes from home  since if the charging system indicator stays on permanently  I cannot drive for long before the battery would die.Thanks.15

A heavy key chain can damage the ignition switch after 16 years.

My opinion  more likely than wires. If it is the connectors to the switch  they perhaps can be cleaned up or tightened.Or the wires cut off and new connectors spliced in  much cheaper than replacing the entire harness  unless this is a small short harness…

There may be one connector that does however. I’d guess it would be considerably less expensive to pay to figure out which it is than replacing the entire harness. If the lights are flashing on and off on a one or two second interval  the flashing goes on for quite some time  that’s more likely a circuit breaker has detected a short circuit in the wiring somewhere.

Rather than suspecting the wire harness I would really look at the ignition switch itself or the connection to it. If the connector is loose then just crimping the connections a little should solve the issue. Cheap fix if that is the cause.

I am having the ignition switch replaced later this week. The ignition switch/wiring (Honda part number 35130-S0X-A02) seems not to include any keys  so it does not include the full switch that includes the lock tumblers. There is also a question about an immobilizer unit  but I don’t think my Odyssey has one.One thing I have noticed is that when the (battery  brake and all door) lights come on for a few seconds  I can get them to go off immediately by turning on the headlights. Is this information of use in helping to pinpoint the cause of the problem?I also have the DRL (Daylight Running Lights) dashboard light on most of the time. It goes off intermittently  but will also go off when I turn on the headlights. Is this related in any way to the above issue?Thanks again for your help.

From what you stated earlier it seems that replacing the ignition switch should fix the issue since wiggling the key seemed to aggravate the issue. I would tap on the switch itself to verify that before replacing it.

Worked OK the next day  but the day after the lights came back on/off again!The battery (new Interstate) was replaced on June 6 and the alternator (rebuilt) on July 20  so they seem unlikely to be the problem. I plan to go back and have him recheck the alternator again.What is interesting is that they seem to come on/off only at low RPM  like when coming to a stop or stopped. Also  they will go off immediately when I turn on the headlights or even the turn signals. One thought would be to always have the headlights on when I’m driving?

It could be the alternator is producing voltage spikes or isn’t properly regulating the output voltage under low electrical load conditions. Your idea to just drive with the headlights on low beam until the issue is resolved makes good sense.

Is the cooling fan circuit part of the alternator?Also  I have had the alternator replaced twice (once on June 15  2017 and once on July 20  2018). Both times the alternator was a rebuilt unit. The replacement P/N (31100-PGK-A03RM) in the SB is different than the P/N (P/N 31100-PGK-A02) it is to replace. Maybe the rebuilt replacement alternators are not the correct units and maybe they do not solve the problem? How to proceed? I don’t want to pay for a third alternator  which would probably cost more than the previous replacements. Should I go to a Honda dealership to see if they can do a replacement without charging for it?

There are several reports of failures/warning lights shortly after installing an aftermarket alternator  perhaps there is a quality problem or they just don’t work well with the ELD system.
121655,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2002-honda-odyssey-battery-brake-and-all-door-lights-intermitantly-go-on-briefly-and-off/121655,2002 Honda Odyssey - Battery  brake and all door lights intermitantly go on briefly and off,Maintenance/Repairs,||odyssey||honda||,14,Cougar,The cooling fan circuit is not part of the charging circuit but like all the other electrical systems of the vehicle they are all connected to the main power system which is the battery and the alternator. Electrical noise can at times be generated by one of the components tied to the power and that noise can travel through the power leads and possibly effect other things tied to the power bus. Engineers will eliminate that kind of trouble by placing electrical filters in the electrical system if it is needed. It may be that a filter circuit was added to the replacement alternator after this issue was discovered with the cooling fan circuit.The warning lights are usually tied into the field circuit of the alternator so they can be tested when turning the ignition ON before the engine is started. So if there is some sort of alternator trouble it can effect the other warning lights also besides just the battery warning light. If the problem is due to electrical noise a good electrical tech will know how to check for it and fix the problem. Finding that person can also be problem  but a place that specializes in electrical problems should have such a tech on hand. Going from your description of the trouble and noting the headlight comment my best guess is the issue is with the alternator  especially if this problem happened after the alternator was replaced. Even though the alternator checked okay intermittent problems like this can make things seem okay most of the time  until it acts up. If the cooling fan circuit is the real culprit here I would filter the line at the source of the problem.

It fixed the DRL issue I had (the DRL instrument light was on most of the time)  but the battery/brake/all door open instrument lights on/off issue is still there.

I suspect that turning on the headlights is causing the alternator to react to the higher current drain on the electrical system and that makes changes to the alternator field current at the same time. I am pretty certain the problem is with the alternator.

How handy are you? How are you fixed for diagnostic tools? Voltmeter? Compression tester? Fuel pressure gauge? From your post  I’d guess you can operate a code scanner and replace parts but little else. If I’m wrong  please post if you have the tools I’ve listed and we can walk you through the procedures.If I am correct that your tools and skills are limited  it is time to have it towed to a local independent mechanic who can diagnose whether it has air  fuel and spark and IF there has been any damage to the engine from overheating. Good Luck!

I dont have a comp tester though. I will be checking soon the plugs  to see if theyre wet after cranking and to see if theres spark. Ive never used a fuel pressure gauge but know the fuel pump works as theres a hum in the back when I turn the ignition from OFF to ON. How could the CEL be on yet no codes scannable by the reader?
123869,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2009-jeep-compass-engine-turns-but-will-not-start/123869,2009 Jeep Compass engine turns but will not start,Maintenance/Repairs,||compass||jeep||,4,Mustangman, [ CEL be on yet no codes scannable by the reader ] Because it hasn’t actually started and the CEL turns on if the engine isn’t running to let you know it hasn’t burned out. Please check for spark  pull the plugs and check for wet. If they are wet and there is spark  it should at least try to start. Since the plugs are out  compression test the engine first dry. If all are OK dry you are OK. If one or 2 is low  then do a wet test with a small amount of engine oil squirted in. If 2 side-by side cylinders are still low  blown head gasket is likely. If both low cylinders now read good  the rings are bad and the engine is on its way out but should still start. If there is spark but no fuel  try a little starter fluid spray. It should fire right up but stall quickly. That tells you its a fuel problem.Attach a fuel pressure gauge to the test port under hood and just key-on to run the pump. There should be significant pressure 40- 50 psi  I’d guess. Google the proper fuel pressure reading for this car but it should be close to this range.I’d guess one of the 3 isn’t present  spark or fuel most likely. If you don’t get either spark or fuel  suspect the crankshaft position sensor as a bad one will keep either from happening.

It might dry out and fix itself if you wait long enough. Checking for absence of a visual spark at a spark plug would be first up for that one. Second guess – less likely — is the overheating incident caused some internal engine damage. A compression test would be first up for that.

On my Toyota Avalon  I had the same problem. Wipers suddenly stopped  in heavy rainstorm. Motor was good. I found that the part of linkage that attached to the motor shaft was worn. Toyota did not sell bushings alone  I was about to get hammered for $200+ for an entire linkage. Someone on ToyotaNation suggested I buy a 5/8 inch “e-clip”   put linkage back on motor shaft  and then secure with “e-clip”. That was four years ago. It still works. Cost me a 50 cents for the clip.

Normally  the bushing on the linkage would have locked it onto the shaft  but it got worn out. The motor shaft had a circular depression around it (yours might not) which allowed the e clip to seat.

Both times I had it towed to a dealership and the problem did not happen while they had it.Most recently  I the car would start and immediately stop. The car will run for about a second  and then stop. I had it towed to the Goodyear shop and of course  it worked just fine for them.I bought the car used and had a remote start installed at the dealership where I bought the car. I had no problems for a while  and then the engine would just stop while I was driving. It would usually run again after a few minutes and a few attempts to restart it.The first place I took it said it was the remote start that was the problem  so they removed it. Again  no problems for a while  but then it started stopping again!I am afraid to drive the car  I don’t know what to do next. Any ideas?3

If you hear a hum from the under the rear seat  that is the fuel pump. No hum  and the pump is probably bad. jostling the car to tow it to the service shop can make the pump run again for a while. If that is the symptom  and the car has over about 90K miles  change the pump.If the pump runs and the car won’t start  let it cool down for about 30 minutes. If it starts right up  change the crankshaft position sensor.

And the sensor itself is reasonably priced  a lot cheaper than a fuel pump  in most cases.Might just pay a shop to replace it. Call it preventive maintenance. If it fixes the problem  great. If not  at least you’ve ruled something out.Paying diagnosis at a shop can get expensive  as labor rates are typically over $100 per billed hour. It might make financial sense to skip the diagnosis and just pay for the sensor replacement . . . with the written agreement that the customer will NOT blame the dealer if the problem persists.

Years have gone by  the car has been in three times each time they tell me they can’t duplicate the problem. It also has a intermittent surge forward during braking which I feel is connected to the acceleration issue. You probably know it is drive by wire and uses a Throttle Position Sensor. My thought is the TPS system is getting a bad signal to both. the computer therefore is confused and won’t accelerate and during braking tries to accelerate. Both these issues are a serious Safety concern. I am now able to enter traffic correctly and I will at some point hit another vehicle because of the braking surge. I think it is the TPS . I have not had a check engine light. Hyundai says they can’t fix it. All they have done is drive it to get the issue to happen. No further investigating has been done on their part. refusing to try to diagnose the issue in any other way. If the computer can’t find a problem their so called techs are dumbfounded. How can you help me ?

If it turns then you should check to see if there’s coolant in the system  oil in the engine  fluid in the power steering. Disconnect the old battery and connect the cables to a known good battery and see if it will crank. With no spark plugs it will not start of course. If it cranks and you are feeling lucky put the plugs in again  open up the air filter case  and spray starting fluid straight into the air intake  and crank it. If it pops or burps or runs for a second or two  congratulations and turn it off. You have to decide how to proceed  but you’ll have to clean out or replace the fuel tank  fuel lines and clean the entire carburetor or fuel injection system.

Flushing the fuel system is a big job. There is likely rust inside the fuel tank that needs to be dealt with. Deteriorated fuel lines will ruin your day if they split and spray fuel on hot things.Also keep in mind there a lot of dried out oil seals throughout this vehicle that are likely to start leaking every fluid they are holding back once you get it running. This thing will be a maintenance headache from start #1. If you are wiling to do your own work  have at it. If you are paying someone to make these repairs  I hope you have LOTS of money - you’ll need it!

Seals are made of rubber and rubber deteriorates with age. ALL rubber. Getting the car started is only the beginning. If this car is to be driven every rubber component will need to be replaced. Tires  all belts and hoses. The seals for the doors and windows. If it’s rubber  replace it. As also noted  the entire fuel delivery system will most likely need to be thoroughly cleaned  if not replaced: gas tank  fuel lines  carburetor. Oil and filter will need to be replaced. Cooling system thoroughly cleaned and/or replaced (including checking of the heater core). Transmission and rear end fluids should be replaced.If you have the time and inclination treat this as a project car. If you don’t you’ll need lots of cubic dollars to make this car streetable. Good luck.

The gallon per minute rate is different at different stations or even different pumps at the same station. The pump I usually fill up at requires me to barely insert the nozzle  other station with lower flow rate I can insert it all the way. Note to there are two setting on the handle  choose the lower flow rate position…If at a station that requires you to hold the trigger  just barely squeeze it. If this does not work please respond to the following.Has the car had this problem since new? Is it a recent development? In either case  if your vehicle has less than 36 000 miles have your dealer fix it. If the problem is with emission control equipment the warranty coverage may be longer.

Gasoline varies quite a bit as the seasons change and sometimes when they are blended in the tank  the gas foams and shuts off the nozzle. There may be nothing you can do about it.

It has been running fine for most of its life  but last year a stalling issue and erratic  runaway idle (along with an OBD code) led me to replace the throttle position sensor. All was well  no more stalls  and it was a relief to have the car drive “properly” again without the engine spontaneously hitting 3000 rpm at idle.Now another issue: when the throttle is barely pressed (like the bottom 15 percent of the throttle) the engine seems to sputter and the car lurches rapidly  almost like a slipping clutch. Once I press the pedal further  the car revs smoothly. Even weirder: if I pump the accelerator to the floor  either before starting the engine or a quick pump in neutral  the issue temporarily goes away. It seems like when the pedal traverses it’s full range of motion before use  the problem doesn’t occur afterward for some time.Just recently the stuttering issue manifested during highway driving  again  only when the accelerator is in the bottom portion of the throttle.I’m not getting any codes or MIL  so I don’t even know where to begin. Any advice would be helpful!12

Perhaps the new one you have is sort of working now  but hasn’t yet been correctly adjusted. Do you have the adjustment/check procedure?

There aren’t any other moving or exposed parts except for the semicircular hole that the throttle’s post links directly into. What would an adjustment entail?Reading further  some of these symptoms could indicate a misfire  but again I get no codes of any kind. Can a modern engine regularly misfire without the ECU detecting it?

Any adjustment issues are ironed out by the computer apparently  after a few drive cycles. This presumes the sensor is obeying the nominal sensor specs of course. You might want to double check those.closed — 200 to 500 mv wide open — 4.3 to 4.8 voltsclosed – 0.71 to 1.38 k-ohm (pins 1-2) wide open – 2.7 k-ohm1.6-2.4 k-ohm (pins 2-3)  independent of throttle position [ Can a modern engine regularly misfire without the ECU detecting it? ] Unlikely. Misfires are detected using the crank position sensor  and if those go bad the engine run very poorly or not at all. Usually crank sensors fail when hot  and often still work ok when cold. Do you have any hot engine vs cold symptoms?Some of what you are saying above could point to a transmission problem. What type of transmission do you have? manual? conventional automatic? CVT?A gunked-up throttle body  faulty egr system  vacuum leak could be involved also. Presuming all the routine engine and transmission maintenance is up to date.

I have a conventional auto.Before I replaced the TPS  the engine seemed happier when cold  but ever since then  it seems to happen irrespective of temperature. I had a Kia Sedona from 2003 that had a faulty crank position sensor  and the violent lurching that that caused was very different from what I’m experiencing.Regarding the tranny  I hope it isn’t something mechanical  since at that state I’m probably better off buying another car. For what it’s worth  the problem often happens with very soft acceleration from stationary  long before the transmission will shift from 1 to 2. As I mentioned earlier  it seems most noticeable at the very bottom threshold of the pedal; if I make a semi-aggressive acceleration from stop  I don’t typically notice the issue.Other routine steps I’ve taken is visual inspection and cleaning of the throttle body with sensor-safe cleaner.

Misfires are detected using the crank position sensor  ] The crankshaft position monitors the crankshafts rotation.When a misfire occurs  the crankshaft rotation slows down.The computer is then able to determine which cylinder misfired  and set a code for the cylinder that misfired.So for example   the DTC P0302 would indicate that cylinder #2 misfired.That’s because the crankshaft rotation slowed down when cylinder #2 misfired.Tester

Suggest to measure the intake manifold vacuum at idle  and if possible obtain the fuel trims (at idle).

However  I haven’t checked them in several months  and it might be time to do it again. It may be nothing  but upon first starting the car  the fumes smell fairly rich  richer than my 2016 HRV. Additionally  my fuel economy isn’t great; I barely get 600 km out of a 55L tank  and I drive very conservatively.I’ll take the car out tomorrow and get the trim/MAF from my OBD reader

Again  though  about 3 or 4 full pumps of the throttle makes all the problems (temporarily) going away. Since the TPS is only months old  could this be a pedal position sensor issue?Also  here’s a total summary of my issues:-At very low pedal pressure (less than 10% or so) car seems to sputter  lurch rapidly until I press the pedal further  after which it works fine. Accelerated like a dream-When letting the pedal out at high speed  occasionally odd transmission shifting behaviour such as upshifting while decelerating-No error codes  and my trim is -3.1. Furthermore  ALL problems go away temporarily if I pump the accelerator to the floor several times before starting the car. However  they will return in about 15 minutes.What the heck could be causing this?

It’s almost as if  momentarily  the engine stops delivering power for a split second  only to return to normal again. It happens with such speed and regularity that it almost (at some but not all times) feels like a clutch that is rapidly grabbing and slipping.

Still a good idea to measure the intake manifold vacuum at idle  easy enough to do. But it looks like the problem must be something else. It is starting to sound more and more like a transmission related problem. The transmission has to do a lot of fine tuning to do at low throttle  so it could be an engine or transmission sensor has failed. Usually that would throw a code. But not always. Throttle position sensor failures often don’t throw a code for example. But you’ve already replaced that as I recall  so pretty unlikely the replacement is failing. Still  if I had this problem I’d remove the TPS connector and carefully measure the ohm reading between pins 1 and 2. I’d want to verify it changes smoothly  with no glitches  from 710 ohms to 2.7 k ohms as the throttle pedal is moved from idle to wide open. Suggest to verify the transmission fluid is correct also. If a routine trans fluid change-out is due  now’s a good time to do it.

The fluid was quite black  so it was probably high time to change it.Unfortunately my issue still persists. One thing: when doing a rev test at the garage  I pushed the throttle slowly and smoothly and got it to about 1500  where it plateaued for a little over a second despite me increasing throttle. Finally  with a bit more pressing the engine jumped up to about 2500 instead of smoothly spooling up to that speed. The throttle doesn’t “feel” sticky  but it certainly feels like I had to clear a certain threshold before the engine snapped to the rpm I was demanding of it.I still haven’t tested the TPS (I don’t have a voltmeter and apparently garages don’t routinely have scopes anymore) but I’ll look into getting pins 1 and 2 tested for smooth scaling up of resistance.Sorry to bug you again but… any other ideas?

Your observation that during a driveway idle test the engine rpm doesn’t increase smoothly as you press more and more on the gas pedal may be an important clue to what’s going on. I’m surprised that garages seldom use o’scopes. You’d think they’d need them more now than before all the computer electronics. I suppose the problem is techs trained to use o’scopes aren’t very common.

I’m guessing a transmission service may be needed. There’s new software available for the transmission control module  may as well get that too. Mention tsb 20710A to your shop. The throttle position sensor function should be tested too. And of course any diagnostic codes in computer memory should be considered. If you tell us what those are  you’ll probably get some more ideas.

When starting my car to leave I was bombarded with EVERY warning light known to man beeping at me. This car hasn’t seen so much as a low tire pressure light until today. The hud was reading *door ajar *parking brake on *check engine *low tire pressure *warning car not in parkThere were a few other light that popped up of which I have no idea the meaning of. I Immediately shut the car off. Turned it back on and everything was gone. As I’m cruising down the road headed home the RPM gauge  gas gauge  temperature gage  MPH gauge  …all failed. Then came back. Then Failed. This repeated over and over. All the warning lights came back on again flashing and beeping reading the exact same various of messages just as before. This time transmission failure and the ABS light joined the party. My signals did not work  nor did the bright light indicator. Obviously knowing that none of that was going on because the car was still driving just as smooth as ever before. I continued to drive drove roughly 10 minutes down the road to the nearest gas station. There I shut the car off & set for a few minutes. I checked the oil just to ease my mind. Once I started it again  everything was gone  completely back to normal  all the gauges went back to working properly. Warning lights went away like it never even even happened.Now the radio won’t work. It displays the date and time. You can change the language and temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius but nothing more!Please help me guys! Kevin17

I’d suggest taking it to the dealer for diagnosis. Don’t be surprised if they can’t find anything. Intermittent problems can be a big challenge.

How old is it?Or  are your battery cables/clamps tight and secure?Just a wild guess here  but I wonder if either a battery cable cane loose momentarily  or if your battery is on its way out.
124458,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-ford-fusion-warning-lights/124458,2013 Ford Fusion warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusion||ford||,4,Yosemite,The only time that I’ve seen something like this   is when the battery is going south or loose?corroded cables.All kind of strange things will happen then. And many radios will shut down to conserve power if the voltage gets too low.Battery connections are the first place to begin when you have a “No Crank” situation. Evenif you have a new battery  if the connections are loose  dirty or corroded  you will not beallowing the full flow of current to pass thru the connections. The connection may beenough to turn on the lights  but not enough for the huge flow that is needed to operate thestarter. This is where many people say that they know the battery is good….”because thelights come on”. This is no more a battery test than licking a 9volt battery. It only tells you that there is electricity…not how many volts or the amperage that flows from the battery.Jump starting may have wiggled the terminal just enough to allow the current to pass and start the engine  but tomorrow you have the same problem.First remove the cables from the battery and use a wire brush to remove any corrosion and dirt from the battery posts and the cable terminals. There is a tool with a round wire brush for this purpose  found at any auto parts store for less than $10 http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/kd-tools-terminal-battery-brush-kdt201/25980576-P?searchTerm=terminal+brush.Before connecting the cables  apply a coating of di-electric grease to the battery posts this will keep oxygen away from the connection so that it will not corrode as fast.It is just as important that the other end of the cables also have a clean connection. Remove the negative cable from the battery again so that you do not short anything out. Follow both cables to their far ends  remove this connection and wire brush the connection and the cable terminal clean and retighten these connections.If there was work done recently  there may have been an “engine to body” ground that was not installed following the work. These grounds normally run from the rear of the engine to the firewall and are uninsulated and most are a braided wire. If any of these are found unattached…reattach them.Remember….this is not a “Sherman Tank” don’t over tighten the connections.Tight…tight………………too tight…broke!!!Yosemite

Last night I removed the hot (red) cable and let the battery sit unhooked over night and this morning still nothing. There is no corrosion and both cables appear to be tight and secure. The car starts fine with no obvious struggle as if the battery is dying.Is it possible that lightning struck the car?However  there’s no inner or outer physical damange.An AutoZone employee suggested the radio was shot. Seems to me that is wrong due to the face the date/time/temp and Ford emblem still appear?Either way thanks for all the advice and help.
124458,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-ford-fusion-warning-lights/124458,2013 Ford Fusion warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusion||ford||,6,VDCdriver, [ the batter is less than a year old ] Well  it could still be the battery  but my money would be on a failing alternator. When the diodes in an alternator are beginning to fail  the result is surging and falling output  and that wild variation in output causes all of the electronic devices to act in a truly wacky manner.I would suggest that you have the alternator’s output tested today  before you wind-up killing that battery and being stranded and needing a tow.
124458,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-ford-fusion-warning-lights/124458,2013 Ford Fusion warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusion||ford||,7,wentwest,Lots of good info here  but I think the use of di-electric grease on the contact surfaces of the battery terminals is wrong. Dielectric means it does not conduct electricity. That’s the point. It is used in places like between spark plug boots and plug bodies where you don’t want electricity to pass  but you want lubrication or protection. If you completely clean the terminals and cable ends with a wire brush and reattach them you can certainly smear dielectric grease over the exposed terminals (after they are connected) to slow corrosion  but it should not be on the contact surfaces themselves.The problem you are having now seems to be  like others have said  an intermittent electrical connection. Have you had any work done under the hood recently? Something may have been pushed around and now a connection is loose or a wire is broken inside its insulation. You may have to spend some time wiggling cables while someone watches the dash.
124458,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2013-ford-fusion-warning-lights/124458,2013 Ford Fusion warning lights,Maintenance/Repairs,||fusion||ford||,8,BillRussell, [ di-electric grease ] Let me weigh in on this with my limited connector experience. Just some off-the-cuff thoughts.A good connector is air tight (or gold on gold). Ribbon connectors come to mind where a fork penetrates the insulation and makes the connection  with the plastic insulation closing around it  making the connection airtight. This prevents the connection from oxidizing.Perhaps the di-electric grease serves that same function. The metal makes contact to the metal  pushing the grease away. The grease then remains in any voids and the edges and provides an air tight seal around the connection.

Suggest to ask your shop to do a charging system and battery test. If nothing found but the problem resumes  ask them to install a volt meter in the passenger compartment so you can monitor the battery connector voltages as you drive. If they drop significantly coincident with these symptoms  you’ll have found a good clue. Makes sense for you to look carefully at the battery connections. Sometimes those connectors will start to fray where the wire meets the connector  or the crimp may fail  creating a loose connection. As posted above  when disconnecting the battery  do it from the negative side  not the positive. Less chance of getting short circuit and its undesirable effects. The radio’s symptom might be that it also lost power Some radios are designed to be difficult to restart when they lose power. It’s an anti-theft thing. Sometimes you have to return the car and the radio to the dealership to get the radio working again.

So the ignition power was okay but power to the dash and the turn signals at least had a problem. This might mean that the ACC contacts of the ignition switch have a problem or there may be a wire connection problem at or near the dash fuse panel. It would be helpful to look at a wiring diagram to check for a common power wire connection to the dash and the turn signal switch and check the connections along that line of the circuit.

124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,4,jtsanders,Read this discussion. Based on this  I’d go with full synthetic oil (not synthetic blend) even though you don’t have a turbocharged engine. This is not an inexpensive change if you pay someone to change your oil. A quick lube place I’ve used for years charges $40 for regular mineral oil  $60 for synthetic blend  and $90 for full synthetic. It might cost them $5 more for the synthetic blend and $10 more for the full synthetic oil  but probably it’s half that in bulk. In any case  the difference in cost from mineral oil is basically all profit. If you are faced with a similar situation  get the synthetic blend for this oil change and then find another place with more realistic oil change prices to do it in the future.http://www.cars101.com/subaru/maintenance2.html 5

The Owner’s Manual dictates which oil to use. [ The maintenance dept person believes the chart and says the manual is likely wrong. I know  it seems unlikely but he said manuals are sometimes printed early… ] It is now 7+ years since that manual was printed. If there were errors  they would have been corrected by now in the online resource- which matches your printed manual from 2011 does it not? You can also look at years before and after and they basically call out the same thing. Who do you trust- the people that made the car or those that are servicing it? Usually  conventional oil is cheaper than synthetic. If they charge X dollars to do an oil change but use conventional oil  they make more profit on the materials…or entice people in with a lower price if it is appropriately priced based on oil type. They are in business to make money in an ongoing fashion from your purchase. The car manufacturer already has your money for the car  they have no incentive to push conventional oil at this point. Follow the manual. If the dealership doesn’t want to do that- find someone else to change your oil…

124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,25,VDCdriver, [ On the back cover of the Legacy and Outback 2011 Owner Manual  it indicates it was issued December 2010 and printed in the USA 2/11. It clearly says synthetic oil. ] Okay  that explains it! My 2011 Outback was delivered on September 30  2010  so clearly your “updated” manual reads differently from mine.Please note that I now have a bit more than 87k miles on the odometer  have always used “conventional” oil  and it does not consume any oil between my 4k-4.5k mile oil changes  so apparently using conventional oil hasn’t harmed anything.
124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,26,jtsanders,The like I poste above said that Subaru started recommending synthetic in March  2011  close enough to February to think it was correct information.
124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,27,Lee_T,I wish I could figure out how Subaru engineering management thinks. They wind up with defective piston rings on Outbacks and Foresters over several model years and when they correct the problem  instead of just say Problem solved  synthetic oil change interval is now 10K miles like Toyota and others  they act like they hope the problem’s solved but aren’t confident so they give an oil change interval of 6K miles. I asked a service advisor about that and she said If you go past 5K miles the engine will go dry and you’ll blow it up. Is this any way to run a company or a dealership? Synthetic oil is expensive  everyone knows it’s good for 10K miles  but to keep my warranty intact I have to dump it out at 6K.
124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,28,Antonio_Tomasado,Please refer to the thread about my 2017 Outback 3.6R.After going through the BS with a certain Subaru Service Tech  I am using Synthetic 5W-30 and in the manual it says if the customer prefers to use synthetic oil  use 5W-30 and change at Subaru recommended intervals (6 000 miles or 6 months.) The things the service tech said (for example; Subaru does not recommend using synthetic in the 3.6 R because the 3.6 runs hotter") were utter nonsense and I told him that what he was saying in so sense at all and what he was saying was opposite to everything I read about the benefits of using synthetic oil.To confirm  I wrote Subaru and the response was as follows: “Thank you for taking the time to contact Subaru of America  Inc. Regardless if you use conventional or synthetic engine oil for your 2017 Outback 3.6R Limited  we recommend oil changes every 6 000 miles or 6 months  whichever comes first. Our maintenance schedule is found in the 2017 “Warranty and Maintenance” booklet. A copy of this booklet should be in your glove compartment. If not  please let me know and I will send you one.”Thank you for the opportunity to be of service.Sincerely  John J. Mergen Subaru of America  Inc. Customer/Retailer Services Department 1-800-SUBARU3 (1-800-782-2783) Service Request Number: 1-30946205872In summary  there are levels of synthetic (depending on refining process) or you can buy full synthetic. I have opted to use Subaru 5-30W synthetic. In the past and on my other cars  I would never run conventional motor oil more than 3 000 miles and  for example  when I pulled the intake manifold and valve covers on my 1995 Grand Cherokee 5.2 L V8  the inside of the engine was free of sludge and compression was excellent for and engine with 190 000 miles on it. I bought it when it had 13 000 miles on it and maintained it myself.
124912,https://community.cartalk.com/t/conventional-or-synthetic-oil/124912,Conventional or synthetic oil?,Maintenance/Repairs,||outback||,29,WineGeek,I have used Mobil 1 synthetic 15 000 mile oil in my 2015 Outback 3.6R since it was new. I bring this oil to my dealer at each oil change. At first they gave me a bit of a hard time  but now they just do it the change. I use less than a quart between oil changes. I change oil every 10 000 miles. My suggestion for you would be that if you have used conventional this long  continue with the 5W30 conventional and change at 5 000 miles. I would use the best oil you can find. A very subjective subject which oil is the best  but I always feel that Valvoline is really good. It is most important to do the oil changes regularly  the oil if it is a high quality 5W30 I guess to contradict myself the brand is less important.

The noise is very hard to recreate or get to happen. It seems like it only happens when the engine is more loaded than usual.I first thought exhaust leak but I can’t find one crawling around under the car.I also wondered if it could somehow be related to the awd/ 4wd system. My understanding is that it is primarily fwd unless the computer decides it needs to be 4wd then it switches automatically. There is some oilon the rear differential. I can not get it to make the noise anymore frequently when the lock button is pushed than not however.I am stumped! Do any of you have any ideas?Thanks2

105290,https://community.cartalk.com/t/vibration-after-changing-rotors/105290,Vibration After Changing Rotors,Maintenance/Repairs,||legacy||subaru||,1,N54E90,So I changed my brake pads and rotors a couple weeks ago. When I took the car out when finished and bedded in the pads  no issues. The next day  about halfway to work  I had a steering wheel vibration. Not when braking  just when driving. Starts around 40/45 gets worse through about 60/65  then starts to mellow out  although it doesn’t fully go away. No pulsation or vibration when braking. Since then  I have had the wheels balanced  replaced bad control arm bushings and still have the vibration. Went in today and cleaned the wheel mating surface on the rotor hat. Made no difference. At this point  I am thinking I have a rotor that is not balanced. This was a C-Tek rotor from Centric. What do you guys think  swap out some new rotors? I am at a loss at this point as to what might be causing this.32
105290,https://community.cartalk.com/t/vibration-after-changing-rotors/105290,Vibration After Changing Rotors,Maintenance/Repairs,||legacy||subaru||,2,Yosemite,First  I would check that you don’t have a wheel bearing on it’s way out.Second  I would check that the inner and outer tie rod ends do not have any play in them.Third  I would check the run-out at the rotors. I have gotten bad rotors out of the box.You also could have a tire that is out of balance.Yosemite
105290,https://community.cartalk.com/t/vibration-after-changing-rotors/105290,Vibration After Changing Rotors,Maintenance/Repairs,||legacy||subaru||,3,BillRussell,tire out of balance is my guess. I once had new tires with that problem. Two trips back to the tire store to get them rebalanced did no good. Finally took it to a Pep boy’s (yes  I know) and all was fine after that.

105290,https://community.cartalk.com/t/vibration-after-changing-rotors/105290,Vibration After Changing Rotors,Maintenance/Repairs,||legacy||subaru||,6,George_San_Jose1,New rotors may have been warped when the wheels were re-installed. Were the lug nuts tightened in three rounds in proper sequence to the correct final torque? Are the lug nuts seating against the wheel as designed and evenly all the way around?It’s usually pretty easy to check for bent wheels/rotors. Figure out a way to hold the tip of a pencil about a mm from the rotor (or wheel) surface – clip the pencil to a footstool or something – then hand rotate the wheel to see if that 1 mm dimension stays more or less the same for all 360 degrees of wheel rotation.

The new rotors are coated with an anti-rust material that must be completely removed  otherwise it will embed in and contaminate the brake pad surfaces.
105290,https://community.cartalk.com/t/vibration-after-changing-rotors/105290,Vibration After Changing Rotors,Maintenance/Repairs,||legacy||subaru||,9,kurtwm1,I use a cheap can of brake cleaner  not only for the rotors but to also get rid of other gunk around the brake system

Just like the 3M one posted by Tester. I was meticulous cleaning the wheel hub. I also cleaned the rotors with soap and water. So I am pretty confident the vibrations do not result from one of those two issues. The thing that really stumps me is how there was no vibration right after the change and then there was the next day.

Did the vibration change ends? If not  then it is not tires and/or wheels.I suspect it won’t change ends - and if that happens  my next step would be to swap rotors front to rear if you can. If you can’t  can you determine if it is one side or the other - and if so  swap rotors side to side.But on the off chance that it is tires and/or wheels  find somebody with a Hunter GSP9700 Road Force machine and have them looked at for Road Force.

You need to check a number of things before changing the pump and you need to tell us a few things before we’ll even guess what might be the problem.What engine? What transmission? How many miles?How did you know your tank had gas IN it if the gauge wasn’t showing any and the truck won’t run?Was the check engine light on before the truck died?Why is your battery dead? It just died? Or you cranked the truck until it wouldn’t crank anymore? Will the truck crank if you try and jump it? What happens if it does crank? When you cycle the key  with jumpers  can you hear the “hum” of the fuel pump? Can you buy  rent  borrow a fuel pressure gauge to see what pressure  if any  the pump makes?With the key ON  can you read the OBD2 error codes from the truck? You don’t have a tool to read them? Borrow  buy or rent one. Post the codes you get back here and answer all these questions and we’ll try and help.

Have non-stop cricket sound when accelerating. Sometimes stops when I’m decelerating (sp?) and go down to 20mph. I bought new tires  and had guys tighten fan and air belts coz they were squeaking. The cricket sound isn’t going away. What could be wrong?18
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,2,mcparadise,Where does the sound seem to be coming from?Does the sound change in frequency with the speed of the car?
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,3,marona,Interesting questions. It’s coming from the front of the car and in ear range somewhere between my knees and my tummy (if I could point outward.) -marona
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,4,VDCdriver,That doesn’t really help us very much. You need to open the hood while the engine is running in order to try to localize the noise. Just be careful to avoid letting any clothing  jewelry  or body parts get tangled in the belts or the cooling fans.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,5,marona,oh shoot! Okay then. I’ll buck up and get out there during lunch tomorrow in the parking lot. Maybe I’ll get someone to kick the rpm’s up a bit and then I’ll know more. I’ll post my answer tomorrow afternoon. BTW  thanks for replying so quickly! e-See you tomorrow hopefully. -Marona
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,6,oldschool,Perhaps those belts you have already identified as being squeaky needed more than tightening like replacement. How old are they?You are not going to ride on the fender are you? You did say the noise appears when you are acceleratingI hope that there was another reason to buy tires that would be unfortunate to change tires because of a squeak and it did not resolve the issue.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,7,marona,Hiya oldschool. I bought tires coz I had to suffer at least 30 000 with the Coopers I bought. They were the worst tires I ever purchased and I felt unsafe in any precipitation. Coopers spun out in any kind of unclean uphill road condition. So this week  when I saw that Lincoln’s head was all showing  I couldn’t wait to choose a nice tire. Okay with that being said. Seems you really did hear me. The cricketing chirp only occurs when the car is in motion. I second guessed myself last night and thought maybe I was wrong… After digging myself out of the snow this morning and making it back to the tire shop to fix the steering wheel jitters  I noticed that at start up and a traffic light  no chirp. This is going to be a bit hard to pin point  but I’ll do my best short of “riding on the fender.” My belts came with the timing chain change over… and that was 25K miles ago. Thanks for replying all!Marona
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,8,wentwest,Is this an engine sound or a sound you hear in the body of the car? Is it louder when you drive next to a wall  like through an underpass? And  just completely out of the blue  if you have wheel covers over steel wheels  and not alloy wheels  sometimes the wheel covers will squeak. Just go around the car and push the covers in tightly against the steel wheels.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,9,marona,Hi wentwest… I have been listening to the sound of the chirping carefully. It seems that I find myself leaning toward the passenger side of the car when I’m driving to hear it. When I brake or put in the clutch  the chirp goes away.I’m worried it’s in the whatchacallits… oy. The valves  pistons  yikes. But then if it were  then I’d hear the crickets when I gunned the engine at standstill  right?I do not have wheel covers. That’s a good thought  though. thank you. I’ll try other things to narrow it down tomorrow.Night. Marona
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,10,Roadrunner,Sounds more like the brake pad wear indicator tab (metal) is touching the rotor telling you to have an inspection for worn brake pads.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,11,VDCdriver,Count this as another vote for the brake wear indicators as the source of the noise. The tip-off is that the noise goes away when you hit the brake. You should have the brake pads on all 4 wheels inspected a.s.a.p.  before the brake rotors are damaged.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,12,wentwest,Another vote for brake pad wear indicators.By the way  for those of us who are losing their hearing slowly with age  remind your kids or grandkids to tell you if they hear these squeaks. I can’t hear them anymore  even with hearing aids.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,13,shanonia,I would lean toward suspecting the exhaust system: springs and maybe flexible links between the exhaust manifold and the muffler. The engine torque  when accelerating  rotates the transverse engine. That pulls or pushes the whole exhaust system. Whatever is in place to allow this movement is scratching/squeaking. It may need to be disassembled  cleaned  lubed with antisieze compound  and reassembled.A big lever that lets you flex the engine against the engine mounts may let you hear the cricket sound while the engine is off.
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,14,marona,Hello all. I pulled out my old thread on cricket noises from the archives here. I found the source and need advice:(Accord '99) I’m still driving with the crickets in my car. I got it down to what it is  only now I want to know how dangerous this condition is. This is the same noise that all the old VW Beetles had in the 60’s and 70’s … It has to do with the clutch. When I rest my foot on the clutch during normal driving  the cricket noise goes away  just like in an old Beetle.I think it’s caused by the clutch arm resting where it shouldn’t. A tad bit of weight on the clutch and it goes away…I went to a mechanic and asked him to adjust the clutch for me after he heard the noise. He said no  “we don’t do that anymore” and he wants to replace the whole clutch assembly/rod/bearing for just under a Thousand dollars. He said that it’s not critical and that I can drive with the noise. My take: a bit of a clutch adjustment is what I want.Question: Is what the mechanic said true? Is this really an all out $1K job? or is it a simple clutch adjustment? How would I go about asking a mechanic for a clutch adjustment to make the noise go away. And in your opinion  do I finally have the cricket noise nailed down correctly?MaronaTHANK YOU!!!
27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,15,love-car-talk,I think the brake indicator sounds more like a scraping sound. Wouldn’t hurt to have the brakes checked if you do not know their status. I think a honda cricket noise is different from a vw cricket noise (which i really like). VWs were designed like that though. Hondas weren’t. I have not heard of a honda clutch out of adjustment making a cricket sound.It is not hard to adjust the clutch. There is a knob down the clutch cable in the engine compartment and you turn the knob one way or another as needed. No one should really charge to do it because it is so simple for them to do. It has to do with how much play there is in the clutch pedal before it engages. Honda parts can print you out a diagram showing where the adjustment knob is exactly on your car and they can come outside and point it out too.

27160,https://community.cartalk.com/t/cricket-sound/27160,Cricket Sound,Maintenance/Repairs,||noises||,17,ksbikr,Ok here’s what was causing the cricket noise in my 2008 Silverado. The noise was coming from under the dash on the passenger side. I thought it must be the A/C-Heater blower bearing going bad so I removed the blower  lubricated the bearings and found out that wasn’t the problem. A day later I turned off the engine and disconnected the battery which eliminated anything engine or belt related as well as anything electrical. The cricket sound still continued for a few minutes after everything was off and disconnected. I then thought what is still moving with all this turned off? Having retired from the Air Conditioning industry I thought the only thing moving is the refrigerant until the pressures equalize which takes a minute or so. I checked the refrigerant charge and sure enough thee A/C needed some refrigerant. Cricket noise disappeared – go figure. The metering device (ie: expansion valve) was not getting enough refrigerant causing it to pulse or surge causing this noise. Hope this helps someone else.

That’s normal. Suggest to start w/fresh oil  after a drive or two take a small (one cup  say) sample of the oil from the crankcase. Put it in a glass jar overnight. Does it separate into layers? Do you smell a strong gasoline odor from it?

You might have a real rusty tank that is clogging the injectors or it might be just running rich due to a sensor problem.

I can’t see any layers forming  so the “watery” problem  if there is one  must not be coolant. Did it have much gasoline odor? Other that being maybe a little more dark colored  it looks pretty similar to what I drain out of my vehicles during oil changes. If there’s no really noticeable gasoline odor  my guess is the oil’s appearance on the dipstick is normal.

Mine had just started doing that and isn’t bad at all but my rear drivers side panel had to be repaired in 2005 due to the city garbage truck backing into and then again when triying to break ice off during an ice storm in I think 2007 or 2008. I just put Por15 in the rear wells and under the rocker panel and in that corner to see if it helps after sanding it a little. I also got on the inside side of the rocker panel. I’ve seen other Corollas that I can tell are a few years newer than mine 2005-2008 by the differences in the grill and taillights  not all but a good deal are worse than mine.

I remember all of the great-running reliable cars which my family had to junk due to excessive rust.Now  I live in Arizona  and it is common to see 15-20 year old cars on the road with NO rust or body damage. In fact  even as once-common models such as the Chevy Aveo and Dodge Intrepid/Chrysler Sebring have become rare due to costly mechanical problems  I still see 1987-1991 Toyota Camrys on the road every day.

My car has been able to stay in the garage during the last two winters due to a Harley being in storage. The rest of the time my car has spent it s entire life outside  My Mom’s old car  a 2002 accord isn’t driven much anymore and stays in the Garage all the time and has no rust. My grandma had a 1990 that stayed in the garage all the time until she went into a nursing home and then it stayed outside as it was used as a work car for my dad and a spare. When that started no longer being garaged it seemed the body deteriorated rapidly with rust and paint issues with paint peeling off.

That tells you that your air bag won’t work when the light is on.

I have never checked the fluid level because the transmission dip stick has a seal on it that has to be broken to pull it out. I have a Nissan published maintenance schedule that I downloaded from the internet. It has recommended service intervals (miles/months) for various routine maintenance procedures (oil change  air filter  brake pads  spark plugs  coolant  etc.)  but has nothing about changing the CVT fluid - it just says to check it whenever performing other maintenance (but never says when to change it). The car now has 51 000 miles on it. Is it past time to get the CVT fluid changed? I always had the fluid changed @ 30 000 miles in vehicles with conventional automatic transmissions  but all of the other maintenance procedures on this vehicle are required much less frequently (ex. - spark plugs & coolant @ over 100 000 miles) than what I always did on previous vehicles (usually 30 000 miles for above examples). .12

I understand that CVTs take a special fluid and are touchy about any variation in its specification. CVTs are generally not repaired. They are replaced which would make any mistake potentially very costly.Yes  you will pay more at the dealer but they know these cars and have probably done this service before while other shops may not have.

They drove the same make of car. One group replaced the transmission fluid every 30K miles  one group never did. Statistically  there was no difference in the failure rate of transmissions until 140 000 miles.So if you’re going to trade off your car after 5 years  don’t service it. If you’re going to keep it for 200K+ miles  service it.

Bad business decision  I’d say!I know people want to treat their cars like refrigerators but if you want the MPG’s of the CVT’s you need to do PM!

Since then Toyota has backed off and now recommend 50k miles.As for Nissan…Considering the problems Nissan has had with their CVT transmission - I’d change it at least every 50k miles.

The years 2010-2012 were much better than average reliability. After 2013 they have been better than average and much better than average. (Consumer Reports April 2018 annual car issue  p. 95.)I think CVT problems from years ago have had a continuing influence on people’s opinions of them.

Low tire light came on when tire was low. Like every 3 months. So I got 4 brand new tire today. I got my truck and my low tire light stays on. No problems before new tires.

Don’t assume the tire place got them correct. Then you need to reset the TPMS for the location of the tires. Your owners manual will tell you how to do this. The internet says:Turn the engine on  then press and hold the reset button. You’ll find it low and to the right of the steering wheel on the instrument panel.Hold the button down until the TPMS indicator light in the instrument panel blinks slowly 3 three times.Wait for several minutes with the engine running  to allow the system to record each tire’s pressure  then turn the engine off.If the light comes on and blinks when you start the car  something may not be working properly  and you should take it to a Toyota dealership 1 to be inspected.It is possible that after 9 years the batteries in the TPMS sensors have gone bad. I’d also read what the owners manual has to say about the maintenance light as that my go out when the TPMS light is fixed.

89534,https://community.cartalk.com/t/seemingly-random-vibration/89534,Seemingly random vibration,Maintenance/Repairs,||g35||infiniti||,1,zstar5000,My 2005 Infiniti G35 has 144 000 miles  two new rear tires and two good front tires. Sometimes  and I cannot nail down or reproduce-on-demand this situation  my car will suddenly begin to vibrate as if I’m driving over a smaller version of those rumble strips on the side of the road. The vibration continues when I take my foot off the accelerator  and will continue at a slower rate as I decelerate until I stop. Often it seems that when I come to a dead stop and accelerate again  the vibration stops  but other times it will continue as I accelerate.But what’s really odd is other times I’ll just be cruising along and the vibration will begin  keep vibrating for a few miles  then peter out and disappear. I haven’t totally nailed down whether or not braking affects it  but if pressed I would say that I would use the brakes at least once before it disappears. Also  it only seems to begin once I hit 50-60 mph  but again  it doesn’t happen every time I go this speed. Other times this car drives incredible and makes the road feel as smooth as glass.I haven’t taken it to the shop because I’m sure they won’t be able to reproduce it  so I’m hoping there’s someone out here that has some ideas. Thanks all!15

Vibration starts and stops as they get in and out of “phase.” Also  possibly internal tread problems with the tires.

In fact  when I rev the engine in neutral as I’m cruising along the vibration doesn’t get any worse. But when I punch it while in gear the vibration gets much worse (this is an automatic  BTW). It actually sounds pretty rough  and I would almost say the engine sounds and feels like its running pretty ragged  but I’m not sure how that fits with the fact that I can punch it in neutral with no negative effects.But then a mile later everything is back to normal and the car is running like a dream.

89534,https://community.cartalk.com/t/seemingly-random-vibration/89534,Seemingly random vibration,Maintenance/Repairs,||g35||infiniti||,11,edb1961,Are the four tires the same manufacturer and model. Years ago I had two new tires installed on my wife’s 86 Dodge Colt (115/80R13). At speeds of 35-40 mph the car felt like it was going to shake itself to pieces. The two pairs of tires were from different manufacturers and even though the tire sizes matched there was a noticeable difference between the diameters of the tires. Four matching tires solved the problem. I suggest measuring the diameter of front and back tires.On the other hand my wife’s 98 Ford Windstar came with 3 tires of one model and one replacement of a different model. It drove with no issues  but the four tires were Goodyears.Ed B.
89534,https://community.cartalk.com/t/seemingly-random-vibration/89534,Seemingly random vibration,Maintenance/Repairs,||g35||infiniti||,12,Mustangman,I’m inclined towards driveline. Driveshaft?? Or differential maybe? This sounds like a case of RWD driveline problem. Either the rear u-loint (or-CV  not sure what a G35 has) is failing or dried out of lube or possibly the pinion bearing has gotten a bit loose. A good driveline guy should be able to figure it out pretty quickly with your description and a test drive.
89534,https://community.cartalk.com/t/seemingly-random-vibration/89534,Seemingly random vibration,Maintenance/Repairs,||g35||infiniti||,13,David_Donohue,I’m with Mustangman on this one. Just so you don’t think i’m another kook throwing random possibilities around. I have 40 years experience in the automotive repair industry and a damn good track record in diagnostics weather it be steering/suspension and alignment.Drive train/power train.And even tire related issues.First off the tires are ruled out.Why? Because if it was a tire or balance issue it would not be intermittent It would be there every time you drove the car at the noted speeds.PERIOD! I also rule out an alignment issue because the alignment being out of specs may create a stability and or a control issue but not an intermittent vibration anywhere on the vehicle. It would be every bit as consistent as a bad tire or a balance issue. But now lets add a carrier/center support bearing into the equation. You have a rear wheel drive vehicle with an intermittent vibration that kicks in somewhere between say 50-70 MPH. If you are hearing/feeling a popping/knocking sound around the center of the car along with a vibration which can range from mild to wild at any given time that is constant when your speed does not change  but changes as you accelerate or decelerate it may well be a driveshaft carrier bearing (AKA) Driveshaft Center Support Bearing. Which are used to support the center where a two piece driveshaft comes together in the middle.

It took me minute to even remember what this issue was (I sold the car a year ago).FWIW  I believe the problem was a stuck brake caliper on one of the rear wheels. I don’t know why the vibration only occurred at that speed  but I had the calipers and brake lines replaced  and the problem went away.

I turn it on and it’ll crank. Sometimes it turns on and sometimes I gotta give it some gas to turn on. Once its on and I let go of the gas it goes down on RPM and turns off. I press on the gas and hold it to about 1000 rpm it’ll stay on. If not it shuts off.I recently replaced the starter  battery terminals and cables. I don’t think it has anything to do with it but I also have a new AC compressor in there.I did some research and may be a couple of things such as the MAF sensors  Fuel regulator  and possibly air intake. Not sure but want to get opinions from others to see what the problem may be so I can fix it.Thank you so very much for your help!14

It could also be a sensor failing or disconnected that is leading to one of the other issues I mention.Are there any check engine lights? If so read the codes and report back. If there are no codes I would be thinking it is electrical in nature and start checking all grounds  especially those anywhere near where recent work was done.How long has it been since it was tuned up last? How many miles?This may be that Ford SPI engine that so many people have issues with. That is usually a catastrophic engine failure resulting from failure of the valve seats and likely has nothing to do with your problem but is something to consider before dumping lots of money into this. This may be a $10 for for all I know but if you get into big money  it might be time to move this one along.Take a look at https://www.carcomplaints.com/Ford/Focus/2003/ 2 This wasn’t a particularly good model by any means.

It could be anything mentioned in this post but we need to find a way to figure out which one. Seeing as there are no active codes  let’s move sensors down the priority list. Fuel problems often cause problems like this and won’t throw codes. So that’s where I would start. A fuel pressure gage would be handy and they’re inexpensive  but may not be necessary. First try this: with an assistant near the gas tank  turn the key to the run position (not the start position). You or your assistant should hear the fuel pump run for 3 to 5 seconds. If you do that’s good. Then turn key off. Then turn key to run position again for 5 seconds. Repeat this 2 or 3 times  then try starting car with foot off the gas. If it starts and runs for a little while  and you heard the fuel pump whine every time you cycled the key the problem most likely is restricted fuel Flow. This is the time you would use a fuel pressure gage to confirm this diagnosis. If you’re not going to get a gage I would next change fuel filter.

So this situation happened right before I went out of town. I was going to take this car out of town but due to the problems  I didn’t. When I returned  which was the next day  I got in the car and it started right up with no problems. I tested the MAF sensor while it was on. While it was on I disconnected the MAF sensor and it stayed on. So that I know i need to replace. While I was checking the engine area  there was a little hose that went from the Air filter to the engine (Not the Air Intake)  it was disconnected from the air filter side. Once I put it back  I turned off my car and turned it back on a couple of times to made sure it started right up and stayed on. Which all times it did. All in all  it was that hose that needed to be put back in and I need to replace the MAF sensor.

If there’s a leak in that system – such as from a disconnected hose – it will cause the engine to run lean and may cause all sorts of drivability problems. I’m not convinced this has anything to do w/the MAF or that your MAF is faulty. Suggest to let us know in more detail why you think that  b/c replacing it may not solve anything and result in more unknowns & a big expense.

Honda extended the warranty on the engine if this ends up being the problem.

Running the gas really low can damage the fuel pump though. The fuel provides the cooling effect to keep the pump’s electrical motor cool. So you might have an overheated fuel pump that is now failing . A fuel pressure test is probably the next step. Sometimes this test must be performed while driving the car at the speed the symptoms occur to be diagnostic.

Please clarify. If you are noticing a sort of shuddering at 30-40 mph  that might be a torque converter problem rather than an engine problem. Google torque converter shudder for more info. You are right that normally when fuel pumps begin to fail  the problem is manifest at higher fuel demands  like when rapidly accelerating or freeway speed driving. But electrical motors can fail in weird ways.

Her original muffler finally bit the dust  and needed to be replaced  along with a new catalytic converter (the flange broke off  removing the old one). My regular mechanic was unfortunately away on vacation  and we needed to get this work done right away. Our local service station has done some minor mechanical work for us over the years  so we took the truck to them. They did  within a day  what appeared to be a good job  so we were satisfied despite a charge of $1000. When my mechanic got home  he cautioned me about the catalytic converter being a universal converter  not a Toyota converter. He said there’s no safety issue but the converter may be incompatible with the emissions control in the truck  possibly causing the engine light to go on  and maybe stay on. I asked the service station mechanic and he said my mechanic was wrong and don’t worry about it. Is this something to be concerned about? Is my mechanic right? Should have the service station mechanic installed a Toyota converter? Am I on the hook to get a Toyota converter installed (at a price more like another $1500)? Thanks so much for your input!Bob2

It uses the ABS system to prevent you from skidding or spinning the car on slippery surfaces. The proper piece of electronic diagnostic equipment can read the error code this system set to turn on the light so it can be repaired. This equipment is at your Toyota dealer but also at well equipped independent repair shops.It is not a critical warning that prevents you from driving the car but it is a safety system. If you live where it snows  I’d get it checked before winter snows come.

During the winter - Some truck drivers still never turn their Diesel trucks off for days on end.

The car was designed as a package to meet all applicable standards and regulations. At the time the design was submitted  a full gamut of testing and analysis was done to prove compliance.Subsequent  a yearly inspection is performed to verify ongoing compliance. A small subset of the original compliance testing is done as part of this verification. Since they cannot do the entire test as it might prove too costly or not technically feasible as a field inspection  a visual inspection is also performed to ensure the parts meet the original design specifications.There could be many important considerations aside from the HC level emitted from the tailpipe. Those are covered by a visual inspection  looking for a compliance mark on the parts. No compliance mark? It’s not guaranteed to meet all of the requirements (even though it may). But the field inspector cannot know that for certain.This happens in other industries as well. Typically called a surveillance audit/compliance test as opposed to a full audit or certification effort.I don’t necessarily like the regs either but I think I understand the motivation behind them.

Emissions tests can be cheated. Maybe you did something temporary that would allow the car to pass emissions and 5 minutes later  it’s belching out more pollution than the 20 cars around it.I’m not a huge fan of the idea of living under California regulations either  but I do remember what LA used to look like on a regular basis  and it looks worlds better now  and that’s because California decided to get extremely strict with its emissions regulations.Did they go too far? In some areas  yeah. But I’d rather see them go too far and end up with a decent environmental picture than not go far enough and end up like Beijing.

One of the ideas eventually scraped was creating huge ventilation ducts that would carry the smog away to the mountains. One must consider that there are physical issues with California making smog a worse problem that don’t exist other places. Had about a 30 mph wind yesterday. No smog at all.

CARB/BAR could phone the shop who installed the replacement cat to verify the invoice is valid  if there was any doubt about it.Unfortunatley there’s a rub. OP is going to have to go through some bureaucratic hurdles. Just getting someone on the phone who has the knowledge of the rules and the authority to do anything about the situation can take a lot of time on the phone  waiting on hold. Hours and hours possibly. Plus getting cut off during transfers and having to start all over again. Then there’s DMV timing problem. If the registration is about to expire  the OP won’t be able to legally drive the car until this is all resolved. So a catch-22 situation can develop  where BAR wants the owner to drive the car to one of their sites for inspection to validate the cat in CARB compliant  but the DVM won’t allow them too b/c the registration has expired.Like I say OP  don’t panic  eventually you’ll get through this. But be prepared  it may take some time and frustration first.Edit. NOte to OP: If the registration is about to expire  send them the payment even though the emissions test isn’t complete. That way I think you at least avoid fines for late payment of your registration fee.

Only for a couple of rpm and engine load conditions at most. This is based presumably on studies that show if the car is equipped with all the properly spec’d components  if it passes those conditions  it will pass for the entire spectrum of driving conditions. If the parts installed don’t meet the specs  then the car might be able to pass the test  but not over all driving conditions.

The ABS system intermittently activates when stopping on dry pavement. To diagnose the problem  my mechanic attached a Snap-On scan tool and drove the truck. The front wheel speed sensors and the rear axle sensor all indicate approximately the same speed. However  occasionally  when the speed gets below 4 mph  the ABS activates and the scan tool screen is totally blanked out. It’s as if some type of pulse is being sent back through the OBD II that zaps the scan tool. No code is recorded and the ABS dash light does NOT come on. My mechanic is at a loss  since he can not capture a code to diagnose the problem. He is suspecting some type of voltage spike but doesn’t know where or how to find it. He has checked the reluctor ring and can’t find anything wrong with it. Someone suggested to me that the front wheel bearings could be loose or bad causing the air gap to widen under certain turn or suspension travel conditions. I checked the shop manual and can’t find any reference to wheel bearings on a Ranger 4X4. What am I missing? Is the wheel bearing a likely cause? What else could be the cause?11
285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,2,system,If it’s a 4WD and it is in 2WD  a rear tire may be trying to lock  especially if you have no weight in the back and if there is a little dirt on the road. It may be normal. Try puttting some weight in the back or stopping a little easier. See if the tire pressure is right and not overinflated. Maybe a little experimenting will stop the problem. If one rear or front tire is low or a different size it could cause a problem.
285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,3,system,I did some further testing and it happens in either 2wd or 4wd. Tires are all the same with even tread wear and inflation. The ABS engages even on a clean dry road. The strange thing is the light on the dash doesn’t come on to indicate any kind of fault. Also can’t get a scan tool reading once the ABS engages.
285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,4,system,Bet you its the front left sensor in the hub assembly.Your problem sounds like one i encountered.

285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,6,willey,I agree  it sounds like a voltage spike. I would suspect the charging system as the problem. BUT!! it could be very hard to pinpoint.You could have the charging system checked and it may not show any voltage spike when it is being checked.I would also check the battery ground cable  make sure the connections are tight on the battery and the engine block.As mentioned it could be a module problem. One way to check it would be to disconnect a wheel speed sensor and drive the vehicle. Se if it sets a code for the disconnected sensor. If there is no code I would suspect the module.
285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,7,Ranck,Voltage spike my foot! Why would there be some random “voltage spike” every time the speed got down to a low number. This has bad computer written all over it  or possibly bad scan tool.I’d try to swap in a junkyard ABS computer to see if that helps.

I have seen it happen.Switching out parts to see if there is a problem is a pretty stupid suggestion as well. I gave him a perfectly good way to check if the ABS module is working and it doesn’t cost a dime to do it my way.Shotgunning parts at a problem is never a good way to diagnose a problem.
285,https://community.cartalk.com/t/ford-ranger-abs-acting-strange/285,Ford Ranger ABS acting strange,Maintenance/Repairs,||abs||ranger||ford||,10,Ranck,I have seen voltage spikes. I have repaired enough electronic stuff damaged by them to know what it causes. The symptoms stated don’t add up to a “voltage spike.”The test you suggest may identify a bad computer  but also may not. The problem always occurs at low speed and blanks out the scanner. The only thing that should affect the scanner is the computer  or the scanner itself. I am not suggesting a shotgun parts replacement. I have specific reasons  based on the stated symptoms  to try swapping the ABS computer.That’s all I’m going to say on this thread. I do hope the OP comes back if/when it gets fixed and tells us all what the problem turned out to be.

If you are doing the work then you need to get parts prices. I can’t do that for you because where you are located and where you buy the parts all make a difference.

If I turn the AC off and then accelerate I don’t get squealing  and once up to speed I can turn the AC back on. I’ve replaced the belt multiple times  and also the belt tensioner several times  to no avail. I’m thinking about raising the AC head using some spacer washers to try to get some additional tension on the belt. Any ideas?5

When the AC is on there’s more tension along the entire belt path  so I’m guessing the squeal is coming from some other problem along that path. Like the AC compressor itself. If this happens in the driveway when you bump the rpms by diddling the throttle  have a helper use a piece of garden hose as a stethoscope to try to narrow down exactly what part is doing the squealing. Placing the tip of a big  long screwdriver against the AC compressor and listening to the handle end of the screwdriver can locate compressor noises too sometimes.Another idea  get a spray bottle with some water in it and spray it on the belt when this is occurring. If the noise stops  almost has to be either the belt or one of the pulley’s.Yet another idea  the belt tension is usually spec’d. Like it will say 1/2 inch deflection at a certain midway point with 4 pounds of force applied. I had to set the belt tension in an appliance a while ago  and used my 4 pound BIG hammer (as a weight) to get the deflection what it was supposed to be. I could have easily adjusted it much tighter  so the hammer method turned out to be a good idea. The hammer has “4 lbs” stamped right on it  how convenient!

I tried listening for noise from the compressor and also the alternator using the hose method and listening through a long stick. Neither one identified the squealing as coming from a bearing. I took the belt off and sanded the pulley grooves thinking they might have been glazed. No help at all. Eventually what did solve the problem  at least for now  was taking off the Gatorback belt and putting on a used Dayco belt. Stretched next to each other the Gatorback seemed to be just slightly longer. I had replaced the Dayco belt a few years ago  because  you guessed it  it was squealing. So this may be a temporary fix. Will find out in the next few days  as I have a long trip to a hot climate.

Good job on verifying the problem is from the belt or something on that belt path. That narrows it down. Did you try hand rotating the various pulley’s when the belt was off? Notice any unusual noises or binding? I’m guessing you are very close to a solution.

In a nutshell it was hard starting  bucking  shaking  backfiring and low power. The scanner showed a solid P0171 and P0174. Lean condition in bank 1 and 2. This seems to be a common Dakota problem. I normally don’t throw parts at a problem but I did buy several items that I intended on replacing anyway.I rarely take anything to a shop but my brother offered to look at the truck for me and I accepted. He checked the fuel pump  02 sensors and the catalytic converter. All were good. His best mechanic checked the little engine for vacuum leaks but none were found. I took the truck home and replaced the TPS. No change. I replaced the IAC valve and the idle improved somewhat. Finally…I replaced the PCV valve and the truck ran like new. It had stuck in the open position and was creating the lean condition in banks 1 and 2. I paid $1.99 for the PCV valve at O’Reillys Auto Parts. I had just installed a $9 PVC valve back in the spring.4

But for an Optima with the 2.4 L engine  there’s four separate mounts. Each takes a little over a half hour to replace  and cost between $150 and $350 each. [ So is this something that can cause damage suddenly? I don’t go too far nor take the highway. ] Yes. If the mount is actually bad  it should be replaced asap. A comprise is to have it inspected by a shop. With some luck  the shop may tell you it isn’t urgent at this time. If just one mount needs to be replaced  you might get lucky and end up with a parts cost of $150 and labor of $75  for a total of $225  not overly expensive.

I also forgot to mention that repair pal doesn’t have “engine mount” repair replacement estimate  instead it’s “trans mount” replacement. Would you say these should be relatively the same cost?

(Creaking when accelerating and de-accelerating),Maintenance/Repairs,||amanti||kia||,13,George_San_Jose1,The expensive mount on the Optima is the side mount. I’m not sure if they’d call that a transmission mount or an engine mount. The mount where the rear of the transmission meets up w/the body is probably one of the less expensive.

The only way to find out a price is to call shops and ask. It would be much cheaper if you could do it yourself but I would not suggest it for your first car repair.It sounds like you want a timetable on how long before the mounts give way. I don’t know if a pro could do that looking at your car  but certainly no one can do it over the internet.

While accelerating  the engine will sometime stutter for one second  then get back up and running immediately after. Then while the engine is at idling and we’re either stopped or moving slowly  the engine will just cut out. When it dies it takes about 20 minutes for it to be able to start up again. Any other time and the engine will only turn over  but won’t start. I tried restarting the engine recently after I died on me  and it started backfiring  and actually blew my muffler  although it was rusty already. I replaced the fuel pump  and yet I am having the same problems  but it does feel like it is able to start up again faster after dying. It still backfires if you try to restart it too quickly also. I have not checked the fuel line  throttle body  intake  or fuel injectors. Although  the fuel injectors look pretty rusted from the outside. The truck is giving out a 222 code (IDM open or high or right coil pack failure)  but it has had this code for a while and worked fine before. For some reason  it also has two spark plugs for every cylinder  so eight in total. So I do not think it would be the code  because it still has some backup plugs.9

123540,https://community.cartalk.com/t/truck-dying-and-stuttering/123540,Truck Dying and Stuttering,Maintenance/Repairs,||engines||ranger||ford||,4,bigbuck,Not exactly sure  but I would replace the coil pack first if that doesn’t work replace the more expensive part and that is the IDM (Ignition Module) if I remember right coil pack is like $30 at Oreilly’s and Ignition module is $70  if either one one of those doesn’t fix your problem I would be very surprised. Follow the code reading replace those parts. Ignition Module is what fixed my truck when it wasn’t able to start. Peace  let me know if that works. Both parts you can replace yourself  really easy.

Ford redesigned the head and switch to fuel injection which resulted in significant power gains over the old single plug  carburetor Pinto engine.

Do you know which one would be the right coil pack? They’re not set up right/left they’re more front/back. Or if it refers to what side of the engine it leads to  is it from the point of view of the cab or out in front of the truck?

Its leaking from the end part where it looks like a ring  but its cut in half and from between its leaking. Is there anything i can do to fix this?Thanks and sorry for bad explanation and silly question.6
125158,https://community.cartalk.com/t/coolant-pipe-leak-pics/125158,Coolant pipe leak(pics),Maintenance/Repairs,||9-3||saab||,2,Mustangman, [ its cut in half and from between its leaking ] Huh? I don’t understand this. If that bent metal pipe is leaking it needs to be fixed well enough to handle pressure. Given this is a Saab  you might have more than a little trouble getting a new part  not to mention getting the old pipe OUT of the engine. It is pressed in place using that “ring” as you call it. Search for Saab Parts on Google and then by the words “cooling system” to see if parts are available.If parts are not available and you can remove the pipe  the head can be threaded for a pipe fitting and a hose and maybe a union installed to connect to the hose. Good Luck!

While test driving we heard a clicking noise when turning the car so we talked to the dealership and they told us any cost after $800 they would help fix. They also told us there was a brand new transmission. So we bought the car well we have spent 500 trying to fix it. Well then my husband was driving it to work and the transmission wouldn’t shift. Called the dealership and they told us to take it to a mechanic. We had them wait about three weeks before giving the OK. Now it has been 2 months and it was about a month of calling and never getting an answer or call back so I called another shop and got the managers name and number who was the same guy we had been dealing with. Well there has been excuse after excuse then he told me it was the solenoids which were under warranty. Now he tells it’s the TCM and transfer case and has upped the price another grand. It has been two weeks since then and he still has no update saying they are trying to get parts from salvaged vehicles. I don’t know what to do or how to approach him to get my car fixed and back to me.12

Without getting it checked by your mechanic? Serious mistakes.Exactly what kind of warrantee did the dealer supply? or was it “as is”?You need to talk to a lawyer. Get all your paperwork together and keep a record of any telephone conversations. Possibly small claims court may be the best approach.

I guess this is piling on but from now on if there is even 1 question about the used vehicle you are looking at just move on and find something else. Without having all sides of this problem (dealer-you-repair shop ) there is not a way to give any usable advice.

Without getting it checked by your mechanic? Serious mistakes. ] I agree with Bill  but right now you have a problem that you need help with. Hopefully it’ll be an education  albeit an expensive one. Never trust a used car salesman and never buy a used car with an obvious problem.The only thing I can offer at this point is to contact the state Attorney General’s Office of Consumer Affairs and file a formal complaint. It may not help  but if this used car dealer is as shady as he sounds  he may not want the AG investigating his practices. He might beg you to let him buy the car back and pay for all other damages to you.

That was years ago. Now; for anybody reading this  I too recommend not buying any car that has problems during the test drive. I have no real advice for the Volvo problem but I do hope the repairs won’t be much higher than the $800 which was mentioned.

But I knew what they were  knew what it would cost me to fix  and that came off of the purchase price.Heck  my favorite car was bought that way. My MR2 had a badly slipping clutch when I bought it. $1 000 came off the purchase price  and it got driven straight from the lady’s house to a shop to have it replaced (I was living in an apartment at the time and there was no way I could do it myself).But  you’ve gotta know what you’re doing and what you’re getting into. If you’re not mechanically inclined and you’re buying from a dealership then the line is “This will be fixed before I agree to buy the car.”I had trouble following what the mechanics have done since then  but it sounds like the dealership sent you to a non-dealership mechanic  which is weird because you’d think they’d want the business since you have to pay $800 up front. And it sounds like the dealership is waffling around with you on whether or not they will honor that “above $800” promise  which makes me wonder if you have it in writing.If you don’t  then the agreement is legally binding (oral contracts are) but it’s also worth the paper it’s written on – i.e.  it’s your word against the dealerships whether the agreement actually happened  and so all the dealership has to do is lie.That’s about all I can tell you  because there’s no way to know from what you posted what is wrong with the car.

It may not help ] I don’t want to discourage the OP from seeking all possible avenues for relief  but unless she and her husband were given a written warranty  nothing that the dealer (allegedly) stated regarding a warranty is going to be worth anything in a legal arena. [ they told us any cost after $800 they would help fix. They also told us there was a brand new transmission. ] Do you have a written warranty  stating that information? In legal terms  only the verbiage that is contained within the four corners of the purchase contract is legally binding. No matter what might have been stated by the guy from the dealership  you cannot modify a written contract with anything verbal.Only a written addendum–signed by both parties to the purchase–can modify the purchase contract. That is one of the iron-clad principles of contract law.

I’d just eat the cost of the purchase price  and consider it a lesson learned the hard way…OP  next used car you buy  the advice here is pretty consistent: Before writing any checks  have it inspected by your own inde mechanic. Ask for a pre-purchase inspection. Costs about $100 and is money well spent. Sorry you are having this difficulty  but suggest to try see if you can just free yourself from this burden and move on. The shop might buy into your idea where they get ownership of the car  as they don’t particularly care how long it takes to fix it  they’ll work on it in their spare time. Worse case they’ll sell it as scrap. Best of luck.

Having problems with parts isn’t that unusual. However  two months is excessive unless you’re convinced the shop is doing everything it can to get you finished.

I replaced the horn and still no sound  just a click (I returned that horn). Having never done anything involving grounds/ wires/ electrical with a vehicle  what are some possible problems and solutions? I’d love to have a horn because there are so many people driving while texting5

Once that spray gets into the horn’s innards  it can short out the coil and kill the horn (and blow the fuse in the process). But an inoperative horn can also be caused by a bad horn switch in your steering wheel  a broken “clock spring” under the steering wheel  a bum horn relay  a broken wire or a corroded ground. Here’s how to check the most likely suspects.Start with the fuse. Refer to the owner’s manual for its location. If the fuse is good  jump power directly to the horn with a homemade fused jumper. If the fuse blows  you’ve got a bum horn. If the horn makes a clicking sound  the problem could be a poor ground connection. Clean the horn’s ground connection and try powering the horn again. If the horn still clicks  you’ll have to replace it.

Start with the fuse and if that is okay try swapping the horn relay with another similar relay to see if that helps. If not then check the continuity of the power wire between the relay output and to the horn.

I presume you do  b/c that’s the only configuration that uses a horn relay. First check fuse 16. The horn switch is part of the speed control switch ass’y  and grounds the horn relay coil (DB wire) when the horn switch is depressed. If your speed control functions normally  the ground connection is probably ok  but the switch could still be faulty. the horn relay should have a Y/LG wire attached. It should measure battery voltage when the horn switch is depressed  and that connects to a DB wires which go to the two horns  one on the left for the low pitch  one on the right for the high pitch.So check that the horn relay is powering up the horns. If you got battery voltage to the horns and they don’t honk  either both horns are faulty  or their grounds are making a good contact.The horn relay appears to be located inside the passenger compartment  under the left side of the dash  near the speed control gadget.

Unplug the horn and patch in a headlight bulb. If  when you press the horn buttpn  the bulb illuminates you know the circuit is good. If it doesn’t illuminate  you can guess the horn is good and know something in the circuit has failed.
124083,https://community.cartalk.com/t/92-miata-ignition-relay-problem/124083,92 Miata ignition relay problem?,Maintenance/Repairs,||miata||mazda||,1,ibekarl,I have a '92 Miata  generally in VG condition  @153 000 miles  had it for 11 years  very few problems  but I don’t put a lot of miles on it. Recently  on a very hot Sunday afternoon (heat index @ 105) I drove it a half-dozen miles to the store  just to keep it’s juices flowing. On my return  at the end of the freeway exit ramp  the engine just shut off. It started right up  but after about 100 feet I heard a sort of clicking sound and it shut off again. I called AAA for a tow  but they told me it would be 3 hours wait (!!). I thought maybe that was a mistake and they’d give me an update. But after 20 minutes and I hadn’t heard back from them  I tried starting the car again  it started right up. I was less than 2 miles from my house and didn’t want to sit in the sun for 3 hours w/ no drinking water. This time the car got most of the way home before it did the same trick. By giving it a short cooldown time twice more I was able to make it home. Later  I was able to have it towed to a mechanic who has always been reliable in the past. He had it for 3 days but couldn’t get it to repeat the problem. He said my thesis that it was a relay overheating was plausible  but that it could be many things and the only way to find which one was to drive it till it failed completely. Well  I don’t want to have it break down in the middle of nowhere  so . . . anybody have any better ideas (preferably someone who’s had the same problem)?6
124083,https://community.cartalk.com/t/92-miata-ignition-relay-problem/124083,92 Miata ignition relay problem?,Maintenance/Repairs,||miata||mazda||,2,Mustangman,I used to have this problem on a Merkur fuel pump relay. I could swap relays with an identical relay that powers the wipers (I think) and the car would always start right up. I got tired of rescuing my wife and hot wired the fuel pump across the relay. I couldn’t figure out why it was overheating  just that it did.Next time it happens feel the relays to see if one is getting hot and swap it out.Given that this car has a crankshaft position sensor and this is exactly what happens when these things are failing  that is a real possibility. They are rather expensive for this car. Check for spark next time it quits. No spark and I’d think the CPS is the problem.
124083,https://community.cartalk.com/t/92-miata-ignition-relay-problem/124083,92 Miata ignition relay problem?,Maintenance/Repairs,||miata||mazda||,3,BillRussell,The traditional way to find intermittent thermal problems is with a heat gun. But I’ve never applied that to an automobile.The method you could use is to direct the heat gun at the relay panel  with the cover removed (if it has one). Be careful not to overheat anything. Use an IR thermometer to monitor the temperatures and keep them below  say  150ºF. But if the fuse panel is under the dash  that may be very difficult to impossible.You might try tapping the relays and see if that has any effect.Thinking about it  relays tend not to be heat sensitive components. A bad connection is more likely. Try wiggling the wires going into the fuse panel.edit: I like Mustangman’s suggestions better.
124083,https://community.cartalk.com/t/92-miata-ignition-relay-problem/124083,92 Miata ignition relay problem?,Maintenance/Repairs,||miata||mazda||,4,Cougar,I will also agree with the advice about the CPS sensor causing the issue. It could also be the fuel pump relay or possibly something else within the ignition system. You stated you heard something like a relay clicking so that is a little concerning. This could possibly mean that there is a loose wire connection to a critical relay and just cleaning up the connection will solve the issue. If there is a fuel delivery problem then having a can of starter fluid should show that up by spraying a small amount into the intake when the engine won’t start up. Tapping on suspected electrical items with a screwdriver handle should show up a loose connection. By leaving the car out in the sun on another hot day may help bring out the problem again while you are at home.

If I had that problem I’d measure the voltage at the fuel pump connector. If it was low   indicating a voltage drop somewhere between the battery and the fuel pump  I’d replace the fuel pump relay on a flyer. If the battery terminals and posts haven’t been cleaned and de-corroded recently  I’d start with that first.

An auto-electric specialist could probe the various parts of the circuit and tell you for sure what the problem is. If you wanted to replace the part yourself at that point you could. But guessing what it is and replacing parts on trial without some diagnostic voltage probing might be pretty expensive.

It has only 98 000 miles on it  and the body is like new  but the engine knocks loudly. Also  the “check engine” light is on  and the speedometer does not appear to work.I am interested in restoring this car  mainly for educational and entertainment purposes  and to gain experience doing major engine repairs. I have done timing belts  water pumps  various seals and gaskets  and even a cylinder head replacement  but never replaced bearings before.I was planning to pull the head  let down the oil pan  and pull all four pistons out through the top. One of my friends told me that I could simply let down the oil pan and change the rod bearings from underneath. Is that legitimate  or am I better off to replace the pistons  rings  connecting rods  and rod bearings together?I would rather leave the engine in the car  and not deal with the hassle of hoisting it out  unless the block or crankshaft are damaged.4

I have seen someone replace a knocking rod bearing by borrowing a micrometer using sandpaper strips and crocus cloth to dress the journal and put in the appropriate oversize bearing  but they were only trying to get a couple more months out of a junker.The right way to do it is to pull the crank and send it to a machine shop. On that engine you have more than the timing belt to deal with   you have two counter rotating balance shafts in the oil pan that are driven by the crankshaft  I think by chains.

[ restoring this car  mainly for educational and entertainment purposes ] You’ve already spend more than the vehicle is worth with the electricity used to post the message.Your crank is bad because there is a bearing knock and there is no way to properly repair it in the car. Pulling an engine is not that hard and you will learn a lot in the process. You can rent engine hoists from your local rental center. I used to pull a 4 cylinder  manual trans  Saturn engine out the top of the engine bay with the transmission still attached. Pop out the axle shafts  unhook the wiring  mounts  shifter  clutch cylinder  exhaust and out it comes. The Sundance should be similar.Good luck finding parts for this 24 year old car that wasn’t popular in 1994  let alone now. And have fun!

One or both tires dribble like a basketball in Michael Jordan’s hand for 20 seconds after hitting a bump. That same bump in a corner makes the car jump sideways whit it hits the bump. Each bump feels like one corner of the car is welded up solid while the other side doesn’t. One corner knocks like someone is locked underhood or in the trunk and they are trying to exit the wheelwell with a hammer.Buzzing?? Not normally associated with bad struts but stranger things have happened…

It can be that way “as built” or later in life after welds break  suspension bushings or motor mounts wear or harden or the struts wear.It can be made better or worse by changing struts. The problem is  you won’t know WHAT it will do with a set of new struts until you install them. It may be fixed with stiffer struts  it may be fixed with softer struts and you don’t even KNOW what you are buying actually stiffer or softer. It is  unfortunately  simply a “try it and see.”Vehicle development engineers go to great lengths to fix these type of problems IF the car exhibits them when new. When the 1986 GM large cars were introduced  a completely new type of shock valve parts were designed FOR these cars to prevent an “oil-canning” noise from the front floorpan on rough asphalt.

THAT is the one you should change first as they tend to leak the fluid out when they get old. They tend to be installed for just the kind of vibration you are experiencing.

It is between the 1st and 2nd spark plugs on the driver side closest to the front of the vehicle. The sensor on the top of the engine to the left of the hot coolant hose and thermostat is the Coolant Temperature sensor CTS or Engine Coolant Temperature sensor ECT. This sensor is connected to the ECM computer behind the glove box  and not connected to the gauge on the instrument panel. While the truck was running  I unplugged the single connector wire from the Temperature Sender  and the gauge dropped down to cold. I plugged it back in and the gauge spiked to full hot  again. I am going to O’Reilly’s today  and picking up a new Temperature Sender.

I bought and installed the new temperature sender  still same problem. I thought the gauge might be bad. I have the old Moonie gauge cluster. I forgot to mention  the fuel gauge  oil gauge  odometer  and gear indicator did not work either  so I decided to head down to the local Pick N Pull  and pickup a new (to me) Moonie gauge cluster. I found one  I swapped out all of the broken gauges  and they worked. All of the broken gauges work now  except for the temp gauge. It is still having the same problem. Arrg. Well at least my other gauges work now. I am happy about that. Okay next I am going to see if there is a short somewhere in the temp sender wire. If you have any ideas  that would be great. Thank you

The gauge should move to “100”. Does it? If not  check sender for short. If no short found at the sender  and replacing the sender doesn’t fix it  and it reads “260”   given you’ve likely got a working gauge  most likely you’ve got a short in the wiring between the gauge and the sender.

When I unplug the wire on the sender  the gauge drops to 100F  like you said. When I plug it back in  it shoots back up to 260F  and the check gauges light comes on. I used a laser thermometer to check the temperature at the sender  and it read 220F  but right below that  i got a reading from the exhaust manifold  and it read 300F. Is that normal? I looked for a short  but I could not find one under the hood. I might need to tear the dash apart. I think that is going to be my next step. I appreciate all of the help.

How many ohms do you measure between the two harness wires that go back to he gauge  with the sender disconnected? Or if there’s just one harness wire for the sender   between that and a chassis ground? Same measurement  with the harness connected to the sender? What if you just measure the sender  without it connected?

The old temperature sender I replaced was actually good  and the new sender was bad. I checked the old sender with a multi-meter while it was cold and i was reading 1800 ohms. with the new sender I was reading 300 ohms cold. I thought the sender was the issue  so I replaced it  thinking that would be a cheap easy fix. But when I replaced it  I replaced a good sender with a bad one.It turns out the original problem was a resistor on the temperature gauge was bad. I tested it with a multi-meter   and i was reading infinite resistance. The new temperature gauge I picked up from Pick N Pull had a good resistor at 90 ohms.When I installed the good temp gauge I was still getting a bad reading  because I just installed a bad sender.Finally I re-installed the old sender  and bam temperature gauge reading normal.new temperature sender: bad old temperature gauge: bad old temperature sender: good new temperature gauge good

Then later now I backed out then put it in drive and all my dash lights came on  steering wheel was stiff  brakes were stiff  and I couldn’t accelerate. I restarted the car and it just worked fine after that. Another day the same thing happened right in the middle of driving and I coasted it to someone’s driveway and I restarted and it just started working. Just wanna get some answers on what my problem might be here. I have a 1997 Chevrolet cavalier.7

When the engine stops running the steering wheel will become difficult to turn the the brake pedal will be high and hard.

These are all normal when the engine stalls. The only thing you need to fix is the stalling engine.

If a new iac is required the part might be a little expensive. Often however they can be de-gunked as part of a throttle body cleaning and will resume normal operation.

I’ve always driven the car carefully for its 70 000 miles. A couple of years ago  I took it to the local Kia dealership and had them change all of the fluids and belts [including timing] in order to keep it running well. Unfortunately  the dealership did not replace the two radiator hoses  saying they seemed fine. But now  at age 12  I’m very concerned the old hoses could blow out at any time  possibly damaging an over-heated engine. If I change the hoses  is it prudent to have the original water pump changed out at the same time? Any other change-outs? I’ve read that Kia stocks parts for its cars for at least 12 years so I’m considering trying to buy another water pump now while they’re still available. The original pump works fine at this time and I am now using this vehicle primarily for short trips around the metro.5

If so there are other things to replace at the same time a water pump is one of them . And yes it would be a good idea for new hoses.I think your confusing the federal requirement of having a parts supply for 10 years if a brand is discontinued or no longer sold in the US.

That’s an extreme case  but under most use  10 years is about right.You can test a hose by squeezing it; if it squeezes easily it’s due for replacement. Drive belts can be visually inspected and if there are cracks  you should replace them . I replaced the serpentine belt on my Toyota at 9 years. It cost all of $42.

Coolant hoses  fuel hoses  brake hoses  evap hoses  vacuum hoses etc. I should probably do it again actually  it’s been awhile. Fuel hoses and vacuum hoses in particular were constantly causing problems for me until I did that  never had another fuel hose problem since. Haven’t had any vacuum hose problems either  but some of the plastic vacuum line connectors have failed recently. What you are suggesting makes a lot of sense to me. I wouldn’t replace the water pump as part of this foray except either it (1) is broken or showing symptoms  or (2) when done as part of a job where the water pump is already exposed and easy to the replace; e.g. timing belt job on transverse mounted engines. If you want to replace something in the cooling system  replace the thermostat. Those are usually close to shot by 10-12 years. Just be aware that taking on pro-active repairs can sometimes damage other stuff in the process. Like when you are removing a stuck hose it breaks the connector. If that happens  whatever broke probably needed to the replaced anyway. There are special hose-removal pliers available which can help reduce the chances of this happening.

There were NO problems at all prior to the thermostat replacementBut right after I replaced the thermostat  I DID have cooling problems  the car was running hotI guarantee you there was absolutely no air in the system. And the car didn’t have one of those coolant bleeder screws either  for anybody who’s curious.I had to replace it again. The parts store grudgingly gave me another thermostat  all the while muttering under their breath that their new thermostat could NOT have been the problemBut it WASAfter installing the “replacement of a replacement” . . . all the cooling problems were gone. The engine went back to operating at normal temperatures  as it was before I ran into that bad new part

Basically the old filter’s seal has stayed on the block and I didn’t notice. I’ve then gone and screwed the new filter on  filled the engine with oil and started it up. Because I was in the car I couldn’t see the oil gushing out from the filter. After around 15 seconds I heard some gargling noise and turned the engine off  got out and saw the puddle. I’ve sorted the filter out and ended up filling 2.8L (4.4 total engine capacity) of oil to get it to H on the dip stick. The car’s running fine as far as I can tell but do you guys think I’ve damaged the engine?13

If it was just at idle speed probably very little damage. Just drive the car  do frequent checks of the oil level. Most likely some surfaces were affected but will still last a long time.

Yes the engine was only at idle and only for about 15 seconds as mentioned above. What parts would be affected with this sort of thing happening? Do you think I need to get a compression test done or just stick with monitoring the oil level.

On the way home  after about 6 blocks  I heard a strange sound and stopped to check. Upon raising the hood I saw oil everywhere. I called the shop and they brought several quarts to my location and I drove back to the shop. That’s where the double gasket was discovered. They put on a new filter  wiped off the excess oil  and made sure my oil was at the correct level. I don’t remember how much oil I lost but there was no damage to the engine. I would suggest you continue to just drive the car and listen for engine rattles or knocks. If you hear none you are good to go. Good luck.

I was backing it out of the garage when my wife saw the oil on the floor. Stopped the engine  and fixed the problem. No problem with excessive oil consumption.As long as you had some oil in the engine I don’t think any harm was done.

I kept adding oil to top off the engine after a couple starts and checks. The engine takes like 6 quarts so I began to wonder after I added 8 quarts and it still wasn’t full. I could tell oil was EVERYWHERE near the filter so removed the filter and discovered my mistake.I ALWAYS check the old filter to make sure the gasket is still on the filter now. This is a very easy mistake to make but also very easy to prevent.You are probably fine as you caught it in time with oil still circulating through the engine and not bone dry.
124646,https://community.cartalk.com/t/oil-filter-double-seal-gasket-mistake/124646,Oil filter double seal/gasket mistake,Maintenance/Repairs,||fiesta||ford||,9,Bing,I can’t imagine any damage is done after 15 seconds of idling. Most affected would be the main and rod bearings though  not the piston rings so I see no benefit from a compression test. There was still oil in the pan that was being circulated  otherwise there wouldn’t have been any oil on the ground  right? So just add this check to the checklist in the future and drive on. When I change oil though I always have a spare filter and extra oil just in case a filter is bad. Never needed it but that’s the reason for starting the car and taking a look underneath for leaks.

I’ve probably use every major brand filter out there over the past 40+ years and while it’s rare - not one brand is immune to this. Some vehicles are setup differently and it may never happen to that vehicle no matter what filter is used.

It’s normal to notice some gasoline odor when first starting the engine. That’s b/c the computer injects way more gas on cold starts compared to the amount after the engine warms up. Some of that cold start gas goes out the exhaust pipe  and that’s how come you notice the odor. If the odor goes away as the engine warms up  probably ok. But if it remains as the engine warms your car should be taken to a shop for a proper diagnosis.

The newer engine has about 150K miles on it  while the body has about 240K. There seems to be an oil leak somewhere towards the passenger side and is leaking onto the exhaust. The previous owner persisted that there weren’t any leaks anywhere  and on the hour long drive and for about 4 days of sitting there was no leakage  but then began apparent. Any thoughts on what or where the leak could be and how much would it cost to repair?2

The oil then leaks out and hits the exhaust pipe.You say this car just had an engine swapped with one with 150K miles? To install a used Subaru engine without replacing the head gaskets first is crazy. That is a known and predictable failure item. To replace them now requires removing the engine again.

If nothing obvious  clean the engine off and check it every day for signs of oil that wasn’t there the day before. The next step is to add some dye to the oil  and us a UV light to see where it is leaking. Until you know where the leak is  no way to fix it. Possibilities betsides the head gasket idea above are valve cover gaskets and camshaft or crankshafts seals. Power steering fluid or transmission fluid are also possible sources.

Still rides well  handles well  looks great! I’m having a problem that I had somewhere around 120 000 that the dealership fixed at the time (if you can’t answer the question I’ll just ask them what they did) and has returned. Under load  like when I’m passing or entering the highway - doesn’t matter what gear  but happens between 2500 and 3500 RPM until the car shifts to the next gear - there is a fluctuation in power  as though I’m pumping the gas pedal twice per second. What’s going on? I’d like to keep driving the car as long as possible  with a goal of at least 300 000 miles  but this is getting worse…4

There is no oil leak but having to add oil before time for an oil change. Honda’s solution is to check the oil every time you get gas. Have you heard of this happening?

What’s important is that you regularly check and add as needed. Honda will have published material about how much oil consumption is allowed before corrective action is taken. [ Honda’s solution is to check the oil every time you get gas. Have you heard of this happening? ] I believe that is written in your owner’s manual as well. Just like having to air up the tires and fill the windshield washer fluid regularly. Not just Hondas. Every car.

While I was getting another he checked my alternator and said it was charging but charging low and it would need to be replaced soon but I had a little time. Since putting on the other battery I’ve had no issues with it starting and no lights ever came on or are on now. My question is he said it would be okay to drive out of town but I travel 3 hours one way to appointments for my kids and would rather not be stranded on the interstate. He said it would be fine but I’d like another opinion. Also  how hard is it to change the alternator if I want to save money and do it myself? I’ve changed them before but on 90s vehicles and not one this new.

It’s not our primary vehicle  and Pontiac’s are no longer in production  which may be part of the problem. We have been careful not to put the top up and down too often. You guessed it  now the top won’t work! The top was stuck in the closed position  then we recently purchased a new battery and it retracted to the down position. Now  it’s stuck again! We inquired at a few dealers who want $800-$1000 just to look at the car  without any answers upfront. Any ideas? I fear your advise is to dump the car or leave it in our garage with the top down  like we have been!Marianne6

The dealer obviously doesn’t want to touch it. That’s why they said $1000. Call around to local independent shops or a convertible top specialist and see who will work on it. It IS 11 years old and parts are only stocked by agreement for 10 years. It is a dead brand but GM may still have parts used in newer cars. But don’t be surprised if the mechanic says… I can’t get parts to fix this.

Approaching slower traffic or reduced speed areas  or curves shes utilizing the cruise to either slow down  speed up or maintain her speed. I contend this is distracting  dangerous and these are not the type of roads the automotive cruise systems were designed for. She in turn thinks I don’t know what I’m talking about. Who’s right?7

Different strokes for different folks!

Cruise control and it’s abilities are a remarkable driving tool. Especially on long western stretches. On winding roads that you described and increased traffic  I think it places the vehicle and inhabitants at risk. Winding roads and dense auto traffic demand full driver attention and immediate speed variation. I think your wife will not be dissuaded by any considered criticism. We are all that way. A survivable accident cures many bad habits and instructs the importance of being attentive. There is only ONE responsibility when a human climbs behind the controls of a ton and a half vehicle. Pay safe attention. Trust Me  I Know! …Safe driving too you and her.

On the types of roads you describe  you often need to change speed quickly to be at the most appropriate speed. The cruise control doesn’t adjust that quickly  so I’m sure that at times your wife is going faster or slower than the appropriate speed because of that. That might not be terribly unsafe  but it’s less safe than it could be.

I can’t quite understand whether she’s trying to use it to change speeds as opposed to using her foot in heavier traffic  or when coming to an intersection. If that’s the case  I’m more in your camp  although I don’t know that I’d call it “dangerous.” If she’s using it to change speeds when the speed limit changes (55 to 45 when going through a small town  then back to 55)  I’m more in her camp.

56089,https://community.cartalk.com/t/why-is-my-highlander-beeping/56089,Why is my Highlander beeping?,Maintenance/Repairs,||highlander||toyota||,1,MissAligned,Hi all  My 2006 Toyota Highlander has started beeping rapidly when I’m accelerating (25-40 mph) around a curve. Last week it did it on exactly the same on-ramp at exactly the same place  and I mean exactly  on two occasions on the same day (do not ask why I’m driving in circles). The only recent change was a new tire  which may have a faulty sensor: the “low tire pressure” warning light keeps coming on  no matter how many times I have the professionals shut it off. I’ve checked the tire pressure several times  and had professionals check it too  to no avail. I’ve also had an oil change recently . . . come to think of it  the beeping started after that. The beeping occurs twice in a day  then not for several days  even through a 250+ mile trip. This is not the “ding  ding” sound of an open door or unbuckled seat belt – it’s a fast beeping  5 or 6 beeps  then it stops. Could this be a faulty fuse warning? A VSC or ESC correction (I don’t know what those mean  I just pulled them off Toyota sites on the web.) Help! Am I doomed?6

I find it very annoying. And if the tires on your Highlander are anywhere as bad as the ones on my office’s Rav4  accelerating around a curve at those speeds would be enough to make them slip slightly  which would make traction control kick in.

That allows a new baseline to be established by the system.I’ve had to do this with my '05 Scion when getting new tires.Note that the TPMS and the TCS (if you have it) both use the same wheel speed sensor signals  so reinitialization should solve both problems.

Am I correct? In case you are not aware of it  your A/C compressor runs when you set your HVAC system to the defrost setting  in order to help evaporate moisture on the inside of the windshield.Small 4-cylinder engines tend to idle roughly  and they tend to get even rougher when the A/C compressor is activated. Unless this rough idle is something completely new  I believe that you are experiencing a normal situation. If this is a new situation  you might want to have your mechanic check the motor mounts.

59783,https://community.cartalk.com/t/rough-idle-went-defrost-is-on/59783,Rough idle went defrost is on,Maintenance/Repairs,||chrysler||,4,UncleTurbo,The rough idle with defrost is due to the AC compressor putting a drag on the motor. It is showing you have a more significant problem. The backfiring on acceleration and check engine light are likely related to the same core problem. Your Cruiser is sick and needs some attention  perhaps more than a DIY can accomplish.

If you don’t spend some money for professional diagnosis and repair  this rough-idling only car of yours will soon be your non-functioning only car.Misfire can rapidly cause major damage to the engine  and perhaps to the catalytic converter.

The dealership took a sample of my gas today. They showed me my gas next to some that they had on hand. They looked a bit different from each other  mine had a little smell of gas and thiers was a bit stronger. What do suggest I do to get the water out of the system?

59783,https://community.cartalk.com/t/rough-idle-went-defrost-is-on/59783,Rough idle went defrost is on,Maintenance/Repairs,||chrysler||,8,Cougar,The trouble might be due noise in the electrical system (misfire codes) due to a faulty ground connection. I suggest you clean the ground connections to the chassis and engine that are under the hood. It may not help in your case but others have fixed problems like you are having by doing that and will only cost you a little of your own time.
59783,https://community.cartalk.com/t/rough-idle-went-defrost-is-on/59783,Rough idle went defrost is on,Maintenance/Repairs,||chrysler||,9,BustedKnuckles,Since gasoline rides on top of water  the best way to get it out is to remove the gas tank and drain it. Due to the baffles in the tank  a good flushing solution and a day or two of drying upside-down with the pump/sending unit removed would be sure to clear out any contaminants.
59783,https://community.cartalk.com/t/rough-idle-went-defrost-is-on/59783,Rough idle went defrost is on,Maintenance/Repairs,||chrysler||,10,Tester,The problem might be with Idle Air Control valve circuit.The IAC valve is what controls the engine idle speed depending on the load imposed on the engine at idle. So for example  if the steering wheel is turned the power steering pump imposes a load on the engine at idle. The IAC valve then moves to a position to step the idle up to compensate for this load so the engine doesn’t run rough or stall. The same thing occurs when the AC or defrosters are turned on. The AC compressor imposes a load on the engine at idle and the IAC valve moves to a position to compensate for this load so the engine doesn’t run rough or stall. Now if the steering is turned and the AC is on at idle  the IAC valve has to move to another position to compensate for those two loads imposed on the engine at idle. So the IAC valve is a stepper motor that can move to various positions for the various load conditions when the engine is idling.If the IAC valve fails to go to the proper position where the engine has a rough idle when that load is imposed on the engine  it means the IAC valve isn’t allowing enough air into the engine. This can then cause the engine to run rich and/or cause an engine misfire. This then will cause the Check Engine light to come on.The first thing to try for an IAC valve problem is remove the IAC valve from the throttle body  and clean it along with the idle air bleed port on the throttle body of deposits with an aerosol throttle body cleaner. Then reinstall the IAC valve to see if that fixes the problem. If that doesn’t work  with the engine up to operating temperature and idling  take the handle of a screwdriver and rap on the IAC valve. If doing this has an effect on the idle speed  there’s a problem with the IAC valve.Tester

It has been a year and I have issues already. I never encountered these problems in any of the brand new cars I’ve used before.I’m not also a very technical person when it comes to cars and my questions might sound stupid to some people so please bear with me1st issue: the first time I took the unit out of the dealership  the engine was so silent that I forgot to turn the engine it off. it happened twice  yes. after just a few weeks of using the car  it began to sound like an SUV or a VAN. the service center said its normal and nothing to worry about. So my question is  is it really normal?2nd issue: this is probably why I’m here. every time i don’t use my car for 2-3 days and its on E-brake  the brakes are so sticky that it produces a sound like its dragging something down there. like 2 bones hitting each other. this will happen every time and it scares the hell out of me when I’m driving  it can take 10 to 30 mins of driving before it goes away. i tried bringing the car last june 2018 to the service center and they didn’t see any problems.let me know if you’re having these issues too.thanks  Diane3

Have them check it out and lube all the pins/moving parts. That is what the warranty is for.

However  you need to replace fluid with regularity; every 50 000 or so; I would not do a total flush; too expensive; the only fluid you can use with that trans is made by Valvoline I believe; the Pentoil is way too expensive; drain about 4 or 5 quarts and replace; that’s all you’ll get out by draining/dropping pan; do it again 50K later; (the trans was made by Mercedes and they put it in everything; first electronic trans they produced)

However  Dodge vehicles  with the exact same transmission (made by Mercedes) note that the Valvoline ATF full synthetic meets manufacturer standards (at half the price for the Valvoline versus the Pentoil).dipstick issue: You can buy the dipstick on amazon.com 1; that’s where I got my dipstick for my 722.6; however  don’t keep the dipstick in the vehicle engine slot when using the vehicle; (there is a concern that it can causes issues such as rattling  etc.?) you must replace it with the original black cap that came with it from the factory; the manufacturer states that the dipstick is to be used only when adding or checking the AT fluid;

The clutch was working fine with no slipping prior to service. Within 20 miles of driving I noticed issues with the clutch slipping and it failed catastrophically at 200 miles. I checked the transmission fluid and it was bone dry. I brought it back to the dealership and they inspected it (after I left it overnight) and miraculously it was full. They are claiming that if there was no transmission fluid it would not cause the clutch to go. Is this true? I would think if the transmission ceases this would put stress on the clutch.13

You should have returned at the first sign of slipping. Now you are in a I said they said situation . Unless you can have a calm discussion with the shop manager you might lose this battle.

It’s been my experience that when a Subaru manual trans is out of or run very low on gear oil the large bearing on the tail end of the mainshaft will seize up or try to seize. Since the mainshaft is splined into the clutch disc this means the engine is trying to force the issue.I also agree with Volvo_V70. You should have returned at the first sign of trouble. Now you’ve stepped in it by allowing the car to remain at the dealer overnight and quite likely someone has added gear oil to cover their tracks.The only way of knowing if the mainshaft bearing is the cause is to tear down the transmission. The bearing running sans gear oil generally turns the bearing blue in color. And on a 10 year car that should mean a total rebuild. I can’t offer advice on what to do. Short of the service manager’s benevolence I think you may be up the creek.

Was the car just due for routine transmission maintenance? Or were there transmission related symptoms to diagnose & correct? What did the shop do exactly? Check the transmission fluid level? Change the transmission fluid? etc …Low transmission fluid wouldn’t normally affect the clutch  unless it was really low and the transmission totally locked up and failed. That would normally be preceded by symptoms  like grinding noises  hard to shift  etc. The clutch operates outside the transmission. It’s connected to the transmission input shaft of course  but externally. The transmission fluid and the clutch wouldn’t normally ever meet.

My clutch doesn’t slip at full throttle and yours shouldn’t either and if there was that much drag you probably would have stopped the vehicle.I would trust your observations as far as the transmission fluid level over the truck driver who delivered your vehicle back to the dealer  he may have the credentials of a back yard mechanic  maybe not.

I will likely go to small claims court.IMO clutches don’t go from perfect to not functional in 200 miles for no reason. The dealer is claiming that with no trans fluid the clutch would not be what failed. I disagree.
123627,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2009-subaru-impreza-trans/123627,2009 Subaru Impreza - Trans,Maintenance/Repairs,||subaru||,12,George_San_Jose1, [ The dealer is claiming that with no trans fluid the clutch would not be what failed. I disagree. ] I’m inclined to agree w/the dealership on that point. You should well-document this incident however  in case the transmission starts to act up later. One way to do this is write a letter to the dealership outlining what happened and a summary of the discussions you’ve had w/them  and mail it certified w/return receipt. If they disagree  they can write you back. At that point both side’s claims will be in writing  so you’ll have something to go on if the transmission fails.It’s possible the clutch failed b/c the tech took a test drive after changing the trans oil  and drove aggressively. But that’s going to be nearly impossible to prove. And it’s possible the clutch failure was a freak coincidence. Clutches can fail in numerous ways  not just the disc material wears out. Broken clutch spring for example.One thing I expect you already know: the advice here is whenever getting a fluid change job  before leaving the shop the owner should visually check the fluid level (presuming such a thing is possible to do  which I believe it is b/c it is mentioned above your car has a dipstick for the manual transmission fluid)  again after that return drive  and again the next morning.

Out of oil means it should be very noticeable.I’ve been into many of these and the common complaint before they bought the farm was a whine that was quite often ignored. So was there a whine or is it possible there was one but you did not notice it?What happened many times is that the ring/pinion would give up and actually grenade the transmission case. I do have a hard time seeing this going 200 miles with no gear oil present. I’ve seen a few that blew up within 75 miles of being deprived of gear oil.

An automatic was on my mind. The autos are the ones that develop a whine.With the manual there’s usually enough residual oil in the differential hump in the transaxle case to keep the ring and pinion lubed. The rear mainshaft bearing is the one that gives up the ghost with no or little gear oil in the box.Mly bad…

If I turn off the engine again and wait until the car cools a bit  then it’s fine. This hasn’t happened during a cold start yet. Any and all ideas welcome! Car has just about 113 000 miles on it.4

Reading out the diagnostic codes is where to start though.
124444,https://community.cartalk.com/t/possible-electrical-issues/124444,Possible Electrical Issues (?),Maintenance/Repairs,||tucson||hyundai||,3,SteveCBT,When you say the engine turns over but you can’t hear anything are you sure the engine starts and stays running? Having all the lights on the dash  no noise and the car not moving suggest the engine has not started.If this is the case I would start by checking the crank shaft position sensor  seems to be a problem with a lot of cars especially when hot.
124444,https://community.cartalk.com/t/possible-electrical-issues/124444,Possible Electrical Issues (?),Maintenance/Repairs,||tucson||hyundai||,4,Cougar,The warning lights are tied into the alternator field circuit for testing. If the alternator has a problem it can effect other warning lights besides the battery light.

Turns out  if you give it gas at just the right moment before shifting into drive  it will go! The culprit was a ridiculously dirty air filter.

He said I needed a new battery. I was surprised that the battery went bad after a year. There was acid forming around the cables but AAA cleaned it up for me. Bought new battery and this morning  it wouldn’t even turn over but interior lights and radio came on. Had a jump and ran some errands and car started up with no problems at 3 stops. There hasn’t been any unusual sounds. The interior lights are not dimming and radio sound has not decreased so I don’t think it’s the alternator. Had the battery checked and the report said good.

That’s not bad over 20 or so years with multiple vehicles.My only gripe about Wal Mart is that when I have had a battery problem under warranty it’s been very difficult to convince the morons in the automotive center that the battery is actually bad. They always come up with this “our conductance tester shows it’s good and only needs a charge’” BS.They simply don’t get it when I tell them it’s been on the charger several times and goes stone dead inside of 4 hours while it’s sitting on the bench. This is usually followed by inane “maybe your starter/alternator/ignition switch/ is bad or the car has a short” idiocy. “Sitting on the bench” doesn’t soak in…Whenever there’s a battery problem under warranty anymore I just go ahead and save a trip by “fixing” that battery rather than wrestle the greasy pig that is the automotive center.
93017,https://community.cartalk.com/t/kirkland-batteries-vs-interstate-vs/93017,Kirkland Batteries Vs Interstate Vs?,Maintenance/Repairs,||batteries||,21,Bing,Here we go again. The battery I got at NAPA (not sure if it was Interstate or not) was made by East Penn. East Penn is a major manufacturer and now NAPA is not having problems with their batteries since going to East Penn. I don’t know who made the Delco battery I bought a couple months ago but have had good luck with it. Can’t remember what color it is-either blue or silver. The Acura battery was made by Johnson Controls and only lasted 3 1/2 years. I don’t buy Walmart anymore. The last one was dead in one year and they hassled on the replacement. Others I’ve had never made it past three years. So I wouldn’t be afraid of East Penn or Delco but the best you can do is test them once in a while so you can replace them before they fail. I now have a tester.

OEM replacement batteries share the same case but may not have the same contents.Identifying the case does not indicate if two batteries are alike. From my experience Mopar and Lexus replacement batteries (both supplied by the Interstate distributor) have the same case failures  they crack near the positive post. The performance failures are different  the Mopar batteries fail like a light bulb  open circuit. This results in the vehicle being towed in as the charging system voltage is unstable causing the vehicle to stall. The Lexus battery will go dead over night but can be jump started and recharged allowing a few hours of driving and the ability to restart. Both battery failure examples occur between 18 and 24 months in a hot weather driving environment  there is no difference in life span.The point is a case is a case  what is inside makes a difference. Each manufacture and retailer has its specifications.

True  there are only a few battery manufacturers but that really has nothing to do with the quality of different brands. Each end seller will have their own specifications and requirements from the factory. Just because three different brands may be manufactured by Johnson Controls doesn’t mean they’ll all be of the same quality and have the same lifespan.Personally  my experience with Interstate batteries was not very good and I quit using/selling them years ago.Reminds me of the post here a few days ago about all gas being the same because it comes from the same refinery.Does that mean that your chicken dinner and my pork chops taste the same because they were made in the same kitchen?Does that mean that the Corvette and the Citation were of the same quality because they were both built by Chevrolet?

My way of saying  there is no more “Made in …” but “Made for …” is what counts.

Instead  all of the batteries sold at Costco are now branded as “Interstate” batteries.Is there a substantive difference  subsequent to this rebranding? Probably not  but for those who are hung-up on the brand name on a battery’s case  perhaps this reality can…finally…put this thread to rest.

The pressure relief in the oil pump could easily be gummed up and causing the pressure to drop because it can’t close. That will destroy the engine is short order if that is the problem. If it is worn bearings a new engine may be in order.

In June  I took my car in because the AC was blowing hot air and the back AC had stopped working completely. At the time  I was under my CarMax extended warranty with about 300 miles remaining. They replaced the AC compressor hose and the back AC motor. It worked fine (cold) but my husband and I did notice that the front AC didn’t seem as powerful afterward but didn’t think much of it. Thursday I was driving home and suddenly heard/felt what I thought was a bunch of gravel running through my car as I was passing a gravel truck. Turns out  the AC compressor EXPLODED. According to CarMax  because of the explosion  there is debris all over the place  specifically in my AC unit which they say I need to replace for $4k or at least replace the compressor (and something else I can’t remember) and try and clean the debris from the unit. My thoughts are 1) they completely missed this when I came in in June and should’ve replaced the compressor then WHEN I WAS UNDER WARRANTY rather than just a hose  or 2) they didn’t attach the hose properly or did something to mess up the compressor when they were “fixing” it in June. Does anyone have experience with this? I am at a loss. Thank you!3

Things like the blower motor or headlights draw that kind of current. To see if the alternator is causing it remove the main wire to it and see if the current drops then. It is wise to first disconnect the negative battery lead before working on that wire as it is HOT at all times and sparks will fly if that lead touches ground while the battery is connected. Keep the connection isolated from things. If the trouble isn’t with the alternator then disconnect other main fuses to see if that helps pin down the location further more.

A battery load test would confirm. It sounds like the “batt 1” fuse is just the main fuse for most of the car’s circuits  so knowing the current through it isn’t going to be very helpful in figuring out the cause.However  one test you should make is whether removing that fuse stops the current draw on the battery. To determine the current draw on the battery  what I do is connect an amp meter in series with the battery’s negative connector. Note that is possible to damage your amp meter if the current draw exceeds its rating. I start with an un-powered amp meter I have that just deflects a magnetic needle as a measure of the current. If that’s under 10 amps  then I connect up my DVM in 10 amp mode for a more accurate reading.To determine which circuit is causing the draw  that’s best done by removing fuses from the fuse panel one at a time while monitoring the draw on the battery negative  as above. Removing one of those fuses should end most the entire 6 amp draw to stop. If you have one of those laser-guided infrared temperature detectors  that can make it easier  as the fuse with the draw will have the highest temperature. This could be an excuse to buy one … They’re relatively inexpensive.That fact that it is 6 amps will make it easier to detect. Normal parasitic draw is rarely over the 50 - 100 mA range. You have 6000 mA  way beyond normal. Anpother way to look at it  6 amps * 12 volts === 72 watts. That should be producing either some heat   light  or some motion somewhere in the car. For draws that big I usually suspect aftermarket stereo equipment  or alarm system malfunctions. If you have either of those  try disconnecting them and see how that affects the draw.

That would cause the stall but you can usually restart easily if that happens. [ I sit for 3 minutes and my battery starts to die and I have to jump it ] This is a bit confusing. The battery dies all by itself with nothing happening? Of you are just cranking the starter until it won’t crank the engine any more?Are you going to try and fix it yourself with our help or will you be taking it to a shop for repair? If you plan to take it to a shop  head there now if the check engine light is on so the mechanic can get a read on the problems.

This is the same sound a car makes when you turn the ignition key once the engine is already running. The car does start every time  but the noise has become more and more frequent. Because the car is still covered under the original warranty I took it to the dealer for repair. The dealer told me that the noise is not the starter  that they traced it to an acuator and believe the noise is coming from the “after market” oil filter that was in the car. They replaced the filter  at no charge  but the car is still making the noise. I am curious if anyone has ever heard of an oil filter being the cause of such a thing? I don’t want to pay for this repair  but would like to know if the dealer is just making things up because they didn’t have the time or desire to fix the car. Worth driving another half-an-hour to the next nearest dealer? Appreciate any feedback!6

Does the noise stop immediately after the engine starts? Does it continue to make the noise for a dew seconds after the engine starts and the starter motor is disengaged? Does it have an automatic transmission or CVT?

I reinstalled it and thought I liked everything back up and it’s turning  but not starting. I removed #1 spark plugs and and made sure the wires are correct per Haynes book. I can feel the compression with my finger  but still no start. Would this likely be caused from the drive gear teeth not being in the correct grooves or something else? I’ve read about hand cranking the engine so the rotor faces #1 cylinder terminal on the cap  but it already is pointing at it. I haven’t hand cranked the engine (I’m not sure how  honestly). Any suggestions where to go from here? Wires are correct  spark plugs are good  getting compression  all parts are good. I’m sure it’s something I’ve done incorrectly  but I don’t know what it is.

You can turn the engine over with a breaker bar and a socket on the harmonic balancer bolt. Turn it clockwise until the timing mark is even with the pointer on the timing cover AND there is compression building in the cylinder. BOTH need to occur or you are 180 degrees out. Is the rotor pointing at #1? Can you rotate the distributor until it does? If yes  it should start. If no  see below.The distributor needs to be removed if the rotor doesn’t point to #1 terminal. Rotate the rotor until it does. The helical gear on the distributor means the rotor has to start at a different point so it will end in the right spot. The oil pump drive shaft also has to engage the tip of the distributor so all that has to line up together. When the distributor drops in  as long as it can be rotated enough to line up the rotor  that is OK.You will need to properly time it with a timing light as soon as it starts. I assume you have a timing light and know how to use it.

Pistons only fire every other rotation.

A lot could have gone wrong when installing the pickup coil. As a rule I always replaced the module and pickup together. If you remove the distributor  remove the coil wire from the cap and connect a spark plug to it  ground the distributor and with the key on spin the drive gear you should see the plug spark 4 times per rotation of the shaft. If there’s no spark check all the wiring and ohm out that new pickup coil. If the spark is good as others have mentioned it’s likely that the distributor is 180* out.

An older version though. To rotate the engine by hand  after setting the trans in neutral  I place a breaker bar/socket on the crankshaft bolt  and turn it in the same direction it turns with the starter motor. (Not supposed to turn the engine backwards. I think this has more to do with possibly damaging the belt driven accessories than the engine itself). This is easier to do with the spark plugs removed  but can be done with the plugs installed. It’s fairly common here to have someone set up the distributor so it fires on the exhaust stroke rather than the intake stroke  but give what say  I expect your problem isn’t that. Instead you are getting no spark happening for some reason. @Cavell’s spark-test idea above is a good place to start.Before removing a distributor  experienced mechanics will place witness marks on the housing/engine interface  and the rotor/housing interface  to aid in getting it re-installed in the same orientation. But if you forgot to do that  it can still be set up properly  just takes a little more work is all.

Does it truly stay in one position without you being able to move it at all? Or is it just very hard to turn? If it’s the first case  I’m surprised that this hasn’t led to an accident already.

After reading that the problem was intermittent I realized it was a power steering failure not a total steering failure. There is such a difference in steering effort when PS fails or engine stalls without electric driven PS I can understand someone thinking it was locked up.

Observer the belt and tensioner with the engine running. Is everything run smoothly or does the tensioner jump once in a while. If this was mine I would remove the belt and soin the other driven pulleys by hand trying to feel roughness but it would cost me nothing to do and I am reluctant to tell you to spend money on a long shot.

They might have been improperly torqued during manufacturing apparently. Normally all that would happen is the shafts would disconnect and you’d have no front wheel drive component. But something weird might happen that could affect the steering I suppose  so verify those fastener torques have been checked.

I think that the OP would likely be better-served by using either Frigifresh or Lysol spray on the intake of the car’s HVAC system.

Remove cabin filter and set A/C to MAX and spray something into the intake where the filter was. Lysol works OK. I like baby powder scent. Wurth makes a product specifically for this problem that works very well. Other products are mentioned in this thread. Hydrogen peroxide works great but is corrosive. Use hydrogen peroxide only as a last resort.

Do you own a digital voltmeter? (they are really cheap at Harbor Freight!)The battery can be checked  for free  at most auto parts stores as can the alternator. Just drive the car in and they will test both. It will tell you if your battery is still good as well as the proper output voltage from the alternator (13.5-14.5 volts). The battery  overnight  with NO charger should be able to read 12.3 volts or more in the morning. If it is less than 12v  you either have a bad battery (you had it tested  right?) or you have something draining current from the battery overnight as I mentioned in #2 and #3. Time to take to a good auto repair shop and be prepared to pay for some diagnostic time.

I am not sure about the cat though. I would think that it would have triggered the O2 sensor in the cat though if that was the case. I only had the position 1 sensor activate.

I had a flooding problem with my VW Rabbit like that when testing the fuel injection system. Wouldn’t start no matter what I did. After letting the gas evaporate out the spark plug holes  it started right up.If you have a v-style engine  this is a problem on bank one  which is the one associated with cyl number 1. There’s either too much gas or not enough oxygen in the mixture  or the o2 sensor(s) on that bank has failed. Testing the fuel rail pressure (make sure it holds when off too) and making sure the air path into the engine is open (engine air filter) are good ideas  but it sounds like you already did that. If you are certain the engine isn’t flooded  you may have to disconnect the exhaust system before the cat as a test. If it starts then you probably have a clogged cat. Sometimes you can just remove the pre-cat o2 sensor to accomplish that. Once you get it running again  measure the fuel trims and report back.

I’ve pulled the spark plugs overnight  but didn’t see much come out of the cylinders when i turned it over without the plugs. Mostly just what looked like mist or smoke. I’ve got a mobile mechanic coming to take a look at it. I don’t have the tools to test compression  but the crank sounds pretty fast. So that might be the issue.

[ not releasing brake ] May be a separate problem. The brake hose to that corner may have failed internally and is acting like a check valve. Replace it and see if it goes away.

It only lasts for about 3 seconds and then ceases. The engine oil light also stays on while I hear the noise and then turns off after those 3 seconds are up. The noise is not as bad/loud when I turn the engine on after letting it sit for a few hours or more but when the engine is still warm and I turn it on  the noise is much louder. I read other forums that it might be the timing chain tensioner going bad but it just sounds like oil isn’t getting to where it needs to be fast enough  hence the clacking noise coincided with the oil light. I hope this doesn’t mean the engine is going to die soon.5

This did nothing but clear the code. How soon will it start sending the code again? If I take it in and the engine light is not on  will they be able to tell anything?

It’s also possible for problems to exist which will not set a code. Not everything is a black and white issue.A few years back the trans in a car belonging to one of my kids got a little balky. My scan showed nothing  the Ford dealer found nothing (twice…)  and a scan/test drive by a longtime friend who’s been a lifelong transmission rebuilder also found nothing. No CEL at any time  no codes  nothing.The problem turned out to be a flaky pressure control solenoid with no hard failure. That’s just one example.

It’s not a recall  which would be paid for by the manufacturer.

Said they couldn’t get anything to come back on the diagnostic other than the P0776 code - Solenoid 2 Stuck Off. Said it could be a valve body issue where the valve is stuck. The closest transmission shop is about 20 miles away and waiting on a call back from them on costs for rebuild and replacements. Sounds like that is most likely what will be needed.

Last Sunday I felt while driving that the car is misfiring and may need spark plugs. The check engine light came on and started blinking  the TCS light came on too. Being Sunday the choices were limited so took my car to Sears Auto who replaced all 6 spark plugs and the O2 sensors based on diagnosis codes and the car seemed to be OK after that.This week I find a new problem: Every time I start the car and start to drive without idling - around 20 seconds into the drive I lose engine’s capability to pull  the car stays on  the RPM drops to what would be at when it idles and even pressing the gas pedal does not do anything to the RPM. 2-3 seconds later I get full power and the car drives without problem.If I idle the car for 20-25 seconds before I drive I do not encounter this problem.If the engine is hot and recently driven I do not encounter this problem but if I leave the engine off for a few minutes I do get the problem.I almost died last night as I did not idle the Car and tried to turn left and lost power while the oncoming traffic was fast approaching - luckily the car picked up power.I need your help in guiding towards the problem - what it could be and what am I looking to spend to get the car fixed. There is no check engine light on. Please help.13

You need a shop specializing in Honda’s  or a Honda dealer. Did Sears do the proper “idle learn” procedure? What is “reset the terminals”? Does that mean they disconnected the battery to erase computer memory? That usually doesn’t work  a scanner is needed to erase pcm memory completely  then a proper “idle learn procedure”  this year might require a learn procedure while driving. The pcm might need some updates  requiring a dealers help. If your spark plugs were original  they should have been good till 105 000 miles. The APP sensor  which is the electronic throttle  has to be moved to get to the back bank of spark plugs  they do fail  but did Sears do something to it? I’ve never seen both o2 sensors fail at the same time. What was the TCS code? How could it be related to misfire? Everything you’ve written says to me mechanics without the proper knowledge wasting your time and money.

I suppose the new front O2 sensor might be suspect also since the trouble didn’t happen until it was installed. It would be good to monitor the signal while the trouble is happening to see if it is the cause.

This sounds like a fuel/air mixture problem to me. Either some kind of air leak  allowing air to get past the MAF unmetered  or the MAF itself is not working correctly. The first thing I’d do is visually inspect all the vacuum hoses and connections  and if they looked ok  I’d test all the vacuum controlled devices for a possible air leak. If that didn’t fix it  I’d probably test the fuel pressure at the injector rail.I concur with @Conosco 's recommendation to find an inde shop which specializes in Honda  or if money is no object  take it to a Honda dealership. Sears is good in a pinch for a lot of commonly needed repairs and routine maintenance  the Sears folks seem to have good training there  but for something like this you’ll probably be better with a Honda specialist. Best of luck.

I too have a feeling I wasted this money at Sears. Definitely money is an object hence I’m driving an 8 year old car and trying to hold on to it.Yes all the recommended engine service is up to date by Honda dealerships. In the past my wife has once driven with E-85 than 87 Octane as recommended. I suspect that was the reason why the spark plugs gave away before their end of life.Thank you again  I can not print your comments and go armed with some information to an independent Honda mechanic or dealer.

Checking fuel pressure is no problem for a competent mechanic with the right tools. Anyways . . . a pro would start from the beginning  checking the basics. And I think you should go to a dealer or an independent shop which is familiar with Hondas. When you drop off your car  don’t influence their diagnosis. Don’t show up asking them to check your fuel pressure. Ask them to diagnose why your car’s running so badly. Let them figure it out. I don’t know anything about a control module code  but . . . if the MIL was flashing  you had some serious misfires  at that time at least.

Sometimes my parking brake slips off the ratcheting device that secures it when applied. To be extra safe  I leave it in gear.

Park on a down hill grade in forth gear and release the brake  the truck will likely begin to roll easily.

I’m hearing opposite answers - first gear vs. fourth gear. The more I think about it  4th gear  being larger  would seem to provide more resistance than 1st gear.

Do the same thing with fourth and you will have the answer.

From my recollection  you will prove to be correct. 4th won’t hold as well as 1st. Nonetheless  I’m curious why that is the case.

I painted marks at top and bottom dead center and adjusted the valves at every oil change without getting out from under the car by rolling the van forward and back with one hand in 4th gear.

When in first gear the car moves one foot and the engine turns over 4 times. In 4th gear the car moves one foot and the engines turns over one time. My numbers aren’t exact but they represent the facts. First gear and reverse gear are usually the same ratio so either one is good. Note: If your engine has lost much of it’s compression the engine may not hold the vehicle on a steep incline.

It smoked badly. I remedied this and now the check engine light is on indicating a problem with the O2 sensors. I replaced the O2 sensors but the light came back on. After about 1000 miles I then replaced the Cat. The light eventually came back on. Should I try and replace the sensors again? I was thinking maybe they got soiled while they were running in the old Cat?12

What is the code related to the check engine light?I would have tried driving this some first before replacing everything. Often crud like this will burn out of the system and you will be fine for a while even though you will have likely shortened the life of the emissions controls in question.Did you clear the codes before replacing all this stuff? The code will usually stay even after the problem has been corrected until it is cleared. I always clear a code at least once before taking it too seriously. You probably had all kinds of strange readings from all that oil getting burned and this may have been largely corrected by draining out the excess and running the car normally for a while.

Cataclean does not alter fuel composition and is safe...Tester
125104,https://community.cartalk.com/t/overfilled-oil/125104,Overfilled oil,Maintenance/Repairs,||matrix||toyota||,10,cwatkin,By OEM parts  I mean the brand that Toyota installed from the factory.I had a car that came with a Denso O2 sensor. I replaced it with a Bosch and that one cost quite a bit more. I thought I was buying a premium brand and that I was making the right decision. I didn’t get a check engine light but the car seemed to have a lot of hesitation and stumbled on acceleration after I installed that new sensor. It would also sometimes buck and kick like someone who didn’t know how to drive a manual transmission.I posted about my woes on a forum dedicated to that car. I mentioned that I had replaced the O2 sensor with a premium Bosch unit and someone posted that I should have used the Denso sensor. Anyway  that Denso cost about 1/4 of the Bosch so I went out and bought one. My problems went away. Apparently the ECU is tuned to the Denso. Maybe the same is true with your car. Figure out what Toyota installed from the factory and do the same.I agree that running a good fuel system cleaner through this might not be a bad idea. I also agree that taking it to a mechanic might also not be a bad idea.I am curious as to WHAT CODES are coming up on the check engine light. Do they correlate to the O2 sensors or cat? What if something else went wrong coincidentally and you thought it was an emissions component while it isn’t? Also  maybe something gunked up the EGR and this is an EGR code and you are attacking the wrong problem. Again  it might be cheaper to hire a mechanic than just throw money at this thing.
125104,https://community.cartalk.com/t/overfilled-oil/125104,Overfilled oil,Maintenance/Repairs,||matrix||toyota||,11,PvtPublic,Hmmm.

Just for the record  I’m leaving mine alone (2014 Legacy).With these CVT transmissions  there is a lot that go wrong with a simple fluid change. If you are going to do it  the dealer would probably be the safest place to have it done. If you have an independent shop do it  make sure they are using the correct fluid and following the correct procedures. The will need a scan tool that can monitor the ATF temperature because the fluid level has to be set a specific temperature which appears to NOT be ambient or the normal operating temperature of the ATF.
115529,https://community.cartalk.com/t/when-to-change-cvt-fluid/115529,When to change CVT fluid?,Maintenance/Repairs,||forester||subaru||,20,BillRussell,yes  I know it’s complicated  I’d only have it done at a dealer. The possibility of error is why I’m putting it off as long as is prudent. The fact that the dealer doesn’t recommend a change is also a factor  ie  perhaps they are uncertain on the procedure?To all: remember this is a CVT  mostly unknown territory.addendum: I like the way it drives and the high MPG.

115529,https://community.cartalk.com/t/when-to-change-cvt-fluid/115529,When to change CVT fluid?,Maintenance/Repairs,||forester||subaru||,23,BillRussell,I get well over rated  30-32 MPH on the highway in the summer. 28 or less in the winter. Interesting to be running under cruise control at 70 MPH and watching the RPMs change as you go up or down a hill.I wonder  since the dealer recommends no fluid change  if anyone at the dealer has experience in doing this difficult change? I assume someone had some training  but actual experience is importance. That is another factor in decision as to when to have this done.

It is similar to changing the fluid in a manual transmission. There is a drain plug  a fill plug and another plug that you use to determine the level. You drain from the first  replace it  then pull 2 and 3 and fill 2 until fluid comes out 3. You start the engine after the first couple of quarts are added  then start the engine and fill till fluid comes out 3. The sticky issue is that you need a diagnostic tool that reads the ATF temp and you set the level at that temp. That temp is between ambient and normal operating temp.This applies to the Subaru CVT.

It was one thing to be able to have a 350 trans rebuilt for $1500 but quite another on the high cost 6 plus speed and CVT transmissions. The consequences of poor maintenance are quite a bit higher. Therefore I say 30 000 and will be very careful to not buy a used car that has been neglected.

Good luck.
115529,https://community.cartalk.com/t/when-to-change-cvt-fluid/115529,When to change CVT fluid?,Maintenance/Repairs,||forester||subaru||,42,Jared_Michaels,this is the most reasonable answer yet; 120K; make sure you buy the best atf SYNTHETIC FLUID available; I’ve got a Mercedes where they said you never need to change the ATF fluid; when trannies started breaking down  Mercedes issued a directive changing their position on that “never change” nonsense. Now they recommend a total flush at 100K. However  remember that there is a problem with changing it if you are a diy person (like me). Its not easy to do as you have to drop the pan and change the tranny filter (yes its important bec those filters can get clogged sometimes). You also have no way to measure the amount needed to be supplied via the intake stick in the engine compartment. As someone earlier suggested  measure the amount removed and refill the trans with the exact same amount. Failure to change the fluid is the main cause for transmission failure. Second  is harsh driving. My wife is able to drive any car and destroy the trans in less than 100K just with jackrabbit starts  slamming it into reverse too soon after coming to a “stop”  etc. etc. That’s why I do 95% of the driving now. Surprise  our transmissions don’t fail anymore. BTW  the owner’s manual in my Mercedes says that jackrabbit starts (in my words ----“punching it when the light turn greens”) should never be resorted to. It doesn’t say why but I know why.

I listen ur show weekly you guys seem helpful. I’m not just some idiot that is normally on the show. I just bought a 2002 dodge grand caravan el for $1000  with 164 000 miles. Very little rust under the car and on the frame. I live in muskegon mi. When I go to start the car  it wants to crank over and start right away  but something is holding from starting with in the first 3 seconds. I switched out the battery to see if that was it and it wasn’t. I’m thinking its the starter or alternator. Also the speakers inside on the left front to back didn’t work while I was looking at it. Started driving it home cranked up rock 101.7 and the driver door speaker and the speaker in the back work just not the one on the dash.3

Why would such a smart guy like you  need our help???Unless the engine is not turning over in that first three seconds it would not be the starter as the problem.If the engine IS turning over (that urrr urrr urrr) right away or even after three seconds it would not be the alternator. Only if the starter turned the engine slower than need be would I wonder if the alternator is not charging the battery enough.If the engine starts but it takes three seconds to fire up. Try the key dance. Turn the key to “Run” for two seconds  then off. Do not turn the key all the way to start. Do this about 10 times and on the tenth time try to start it. If it starts right away  the fuel pump is not holding residual pressure and needs to be replaced.If it still has trouble starting  I would look into new plugs and plug wires if it isn’t "coil over  an air filter  PCV valve.Are you smarter now!!!Yosemite

I have found some of these that seem to operate properly for the first 20 minutes because the fans are running at low speed but after the engine coolant temperature reaches 230 F the PCM switches the fans from low to high  if the fan motors won’t operate on high speed the vehicle overheats.

When it is heating up put an infra red temp gun on the radiator  if there are cooler spots it is plugged. This car is old enough that a neglected cooling system can clog a new radiator.

You could have a head-gasket breach between the cylinder and the coolant. That will cause overheating. A test for exhaust gasses in the coolant is the best way to determine if that’s the problem. Bubbles in the coolant in the radiator when the engine is warmed up and running is another  esp if the bubbles get visibly worse when the engine rpm is rapidly increased briefly.That said  given everything you say I’m guessing you aren’t getting the proper flow rate through the engine and/or radiator  due to clogs  or you got air trapped in the cooling system. As mentioned above  removing the thermostat is a bad idea. The thermostat is what decides what % of the flow goes to the engine and which goes to the radiator. Modern cooling systems will almost always overheat if you remove the thermostat.

Otherwise there can be air in the plumbing  and that can cause problems.

Getting to be pretty common here so we’re just talking to each other.I had a friend (not from this country) that had a flat in the ramp so I went with him to change the tire. I can’t remember what car it was but one of those little Chevy or Toyotas. At any rate it had 4 bolts but it was so rusted that dang if I didn’t break one off. I don’t exactly carry PB with me. So we changed the tire and I told him to get the stud replaced pronto. Some months later I asked him about it and no he never did get it fixed so he’d been driving around the metro area with three bolts. I’ve tried but some folks just aren’t as keen on car upkeep. Some time after that he just got a different car. But he made it on three bolts for quite a while. Engineers do build in stress factors I guess.

This allows you to check that they work. When the engine starts  they should all go out.If you have the owners manual  it will show the lights on the dash and what each actually means. If you don’t you can download one from the internet.I’d restore the clamps to where they were  and take it back to the place you bought it.For future reference  once a car seriously overheats  as your car did  the engine is probably toast.Also for future reference  never buy a used car unless: 1. you have it checked over by your mechanic. and 2. you have put aside money for repairs  because it will need repairs. The cheaper the selling price  the more money needed for repairs.

There still could have been some flow if the clamps were not working 100%. This could have been what the owner was smelling  coolant!!! The smoking in the original post could have been steam escaping  or getting burnt off on the hot engine.You did say that there were no warning lights. I would replace the two hoses  refill any coolant lost  and start it up. Before starting turn the key to Run  without starting the engine and check that the warning lights do work.Yosemite

It is weird though because when the engine started smoking and smelling like burnt rubber  no lights came on. We pulled over right there.Mr. Volvo thanks for your advice but I wouldn’t be any better than the piece of crap that sold me the car if I fixed it enough just to trade it in. I would have to tell whoever that is gettig this car what I went thru. Now if it is a dealership and they agree to take it as a trade in  then I would assume that it could be fixed. Yes in the future I will ask someone to come with me. Thank you all for your help. I really do appreciate it. It has been dead since Febuary because We are barley getting by. The dealership even put the wrong name on the title. When i told them they said just go down to the courthouse pay to have it changed then we will reimburse you. Meanwhile I had no way to go and no way to pay to have it corrected. Lol It was just a bad place.Thanks for yall’s time and help again.Vickie

There is no reason to replace the heater core if the engine no longer runs. After you repair the engine you should run a proper bypass hose for those two clamped off hoses.

I really appreciate it. I did learn a big lesson. Not to trust car salesmen I just moved where I’m at now and I don’t know anybody.

Y’all have a wonderful day today  and thank you again for your time. At least now I have some ideal what needs and doesn’t need to be done or replaced. I thought I was going to have to replace the entire radiator. Back when I was young  my dad did teach me how to change a tire  change the oil  (Although I never had the strength to get the bolt off the oil pan) then made me change out a universal joint out on a 76 pea green Mavrick.

Not to trust car salesmen ] I don’t think a car salesman that buys and sells junk is going to look for strange problems like clamps blocking off the heater  you have to inspect the car yourself and if you are not capable you should take the vehicle to a shop for a pre purchase inspection. [ At least now I have some ideal what needs and doesn’t need to be done or replaced. ] And what is that? You haven’t given us any clues about the no start problem  is the battery dead? Does the engine crank over? I can only speculate that the engine was damaged from overheating.
124578,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2007-chrysler-pt-cruiser-radiator-hose/124578,2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser radiator hose,Maintenance/Repairs,||ptcruiser||chrysler||,16,Yosemite, [ Feb 14  2018 it wouldn’t start. It has been sitting here ] I presume that the leaking coolant made the serpentine belt slip  and it didn’t charge the battery enough to keep enough of a charge for it to start again. [ When I was finally able to get the cap off radiator was full. ] This makes me think that you did not overheat the engine enough to do much damage. It may have been low and the engine ran hot. Are you sure you were checking the coolant and not the washer fluid. [ and found where they clamped off both hoses. ] Those are heater hoses with the clamps on them. Do the hoses actually go anywhere  or are they cut off where the fluid gushed out when you removed the clamp. Just removing the clamp should only allow coolant to flow up the hose and into the heater core.You will have to look close  and find if the hoses are cut off  or does one have a crack that is leaking. They should run to two pipes that exit the firewall near where the glovebox would be  but on the engine side of the firewall.I think they clamped off the hoses  because one has a crack or torn hole. They clamped them off to get it to the dealer.Or the dealers mechanic clamped them off and had planned to replace wherever the leak is  but the salesman sold the car out from under the mechanic…along with his tools (clamps).One hose sends coolant to the heater core and the other is the return hose. I would pick the best hose and temporarily remove one hose and loop the other (best hose) back onto the other fitting and tighten both hoses. This will bypass the heater core for the time being  until you find out if the engine is still runnable. Just to be clear; You do not loop where the two hoses come through the firewall  but where they exit the engine…near the passenger side fender. Then get the battery charged overnight  and refill any lost coolant  and check to be sure this has enough oil.If it starts  and seems to run ok…you can investigate  or have someone else change out those hoses.You could run it this way for months if need be  but you at some point will want your defrosters back.I’ll be back at my shop later and will look at my PT cruiser  to see where in the engine bay this picture was taken of. It really doesn’t make sense that the heater hoses are there  because that is the Master cylinder on the right…so that would make this above the tranny end of the motor.Yosemite

If the seller won’t let you do that  you know to walk away because the seller knows there’s something wrong with the car he doesn’t want you to find out about.

That would cost money  which cuts into the profit margin. You were willing to just fork over the cash. They knew you or someone like you would come along without them spending money on it. [ I know if I had a car dearletship  I would have a mechanic look over any car I bought to sell again. ] You’re honest. They’re not. Any time you’re talking to a salesman at a dealership  assume they’re lying. That way you’re pleasantly surprised when you find the 1% of them who aren’t.BTW  car salesmen often know absolutely nothing about cars. If they look under the hood (they probably don’t) they wouldn’t know that those clamps weren’t put on at the factory because they’d have no idea what they were looking at.I once overheard a salesdweeb tell a customer “it has a turbo  so it’ll be good in the snow.” No one who knows anything about cars at all would ever utter such an idiotic statement.

Yep exactly! They were looking for someone line me alright. There were only two men there. They even looked related. They knew. They got me. I’m just glad both my girls were not hurt and everyone is safe. Guess I learned my lesson the hard way. It does crank so maybe there is still hope if I can fix the hoses like you said. Saving up now for someone to just look at it.

Whether any damage was done or not from coolant that was not circulating cannot be told at this point without having someone look at it that knows something about cars.In the long thread on “buy here pay here”  there might be some pearls of wisdom that could help. It’s not uncommon to hear someone bought a car and had problems and it just sits because they can’t afford to fix it and now are in a mess.

The specific comment as I recall was that it wasn’t uncommon for a shop to discover a customer’s 4L60E had the wrong filter installed when they opened it up for diagnosis  and that was causing drivability symptoms.

27582,https://community.cartalk.com/t/4l60e-worst-transmission-ever-made/27582,4L60E - Worst transmission ever made?,Maintenance/Repairs,||sts||cadillac||,30,k.whitneyskillz_141616,This is definitely by a longshot the worst transmission I’ve ever owned. I should have stopped buying vehicles with this transmission a long time ago because I’ve now owned 4 with the 4l60e and they’ve ALL failed on me. Usually I’ve just sold them once it happens but this time I rebuilt it. So far it’s good. We’ll see but I can pretty much guarantee that at roughly 125k miles from this rebuild it will fail again. The reason why I’ve still bought them is because generally these vehicles are really easy to work on and parts are cheap as far as everything but the the transmission. GM knows these transmissions fail at very low and regular intervals and they refuse to change it. They make a ton of money on replacement transmissions and rebuild kits. That’s why and people will continue to buy them despite the subpar transmissions because they know that their vehicles are easy to work on and cheap. That’s why I’ve owned a few. I’m not happy with it each time it happens but I know it’s going to happen. This time I was smart and just budgeted a transmission rebuild with the cost of the vehicle. Sure enough 128k miles on the suburban and the transmission failed. To me I still think this is incredibly dishonest  sloppy  careless  and greedy of a company to do this. No wonder they had to have a bail out from the tax payers.

He has told me that in those 40 years almost (key word…) every transmission failure he has seen was due to not changing the fluid or running the transmission fluid low due to an overlooked or ignored external leakwith some damaged by coolant entering the transmission from a leaky fluid cooler.So how often do you service your transmissions?

The 4L60E in my son’s Camaro just hit a quarter of a million miles and shifts like it’s brand new and the one in my Sonoma also shifts like new at a 130k miles.Kind of reminds me of the person who posted on this forum some years ago with a Volvo with a transmission that died at 160k miles. They insisted Volvo transmissions were junk  Volvo is a bunch of low lifes for not providing a warranty at 160k miles and so on. They finally admitted the trans had never been serviced but still blamed Volvo.

I bought the truck used and had no idea what it had been through up to that point. I’m guessing I hadn’t done a fluid change myself  though I’d only had it for ~15k miles. Odd thing is that I absolutely don’t remember having any transmission trouble on that particular vehicle…guess my memory is failing with age!

Check the fluid every oil change though. Same problem. I get about 125k miles every time. Other than weak ass transmissions chevy is decent. I’m a big fan of the old 5.7 350 motors and the 396 and the 454. 472 cadi engine. It’s just this particular transmission that is terrible. Yes I know there’s a few out there that do well and get more than 125k miles but I’ve never personally owned one that does better than that. In my opinion after owning over 100 vehicles in my life the 4l60e is the worst transmission I’ve ever owned.

If not  check the fuse and relay. they are in the right front corner. Realistically  you’ll have to remove the battery  and possibly the tray  to access those parts. Unless you like skinned knuckles and/or have extremely small hands. I don’tThe air pump itself is located under the radiator core supportIf that’s all fine  you need this kit  which includes updated wiring and hoses. There’s instructions includedhttp://www.rockauto.com/catalog/moreinfo.php?pk=1056571&cc=1371440 454Here’s a copy of an AC Delco bulletin  relating to that water which pet peters mentionedBy the way  a few weeks ago  I fixed an S10 which needed the kit AND the relay. If you need the kit  you should consider doing the relay also.http://www.rockauto.com/catalog/moreinfo.php?pk=164165&cc=1371440 256The truck I was working on was never in contact with water. My point is  even if the pump didn’t get wet  it probably failed anyways. The pump I replaced had absolutely no signs of water damage  it wasn’t even frozen.The good news is that some of the big name brick and mortar parts stores have what you need in stock

The problem could be in the tube from the reed valve to the exhaust manifold. The tube may be clogged or there could be a clog in the molded passageway in the manifold. Spray out the tube and the passageways with gumout or other carb cleaner until you don’t get a spray back.

The computer programs extra fuel for the cold engine to get it started  then detects the rich condition so it commands the air pump to come on to burn the excess fuel  further heating up the exhaust gasses and quickly heating up the warm up cat converter.If the O2 sensor doesn’t sense the correct air fuel ratio after the air pump comes on  you get the P0410 code. First you need to determine accurately if the pump is coming on. If it is  the air is being blocked somewhere. If not and all components are good  then there is a break in the circuit that you have not found yet.

Would it be called something else? Edit: Ok  now I see it listed under S10/T10 truck.First off there’s tsb 04-06-04-015A you should be aware of  which says water may infiltrate & corrode the pump or vent solenoid & freeze or corrode the pump. If so the pump must be replaced.The way it seems to work  the PCM turns on the air pump relay by g rounding the relay’s coil (brown wire). Power to the pump then flows from the battery through a 175 amp fuse to a 30 amp air fuse  and a 10 amp sol air fuse. If you got battery voltage at the pump on the red and pink/black wires  and chassis ground on the black wires  it should turn on. If it doesn’t the pump is faulty.

Roughly once per year each one will go bad with apparently the pistons not releasing which causes moderate to heavy front end vibration in whichever wheel the caliper is sticking. The new caliper takes care of the issue and is fine for approximately 10 000 plus miles when it will do it again. Both brake hoses have also been replaced. The ABS light is on and my mechanic said the diagnosis did not give a definitive reason for what may be wrong with the ABS system. My wonder is if there is something wrong with the ABS system that is causing the brake calipers to go bad annually or if this could be caused by another issue. Thanks in advance for any advice.4

Extraordinarily heavy use of the brakes? Driving frequently on long steep mountain down-hills or just a driving style that applies the brakes a lot. I quite often see drivers ahead of me in urban-type driving that are applying the brakes 10 or 15 times over the course of a couple of miles between stoplights while I only apply them once  gently as I approach the light. Overheating the brakes can damage the calipers. If not that  unlucky and getting defective calipers or maybe the wrong part number for the caliper is being installed  or there’s something wrong with the mounting brackets or bolts. Something bent in other words. Has the vehicle ever been in an accident?ABS problems usually require a factory scan tool to solve. Not following the factory recommended ABS bleed procedure is pretty common and can lead to weird symptoms.

Check the accelerator pedal position sensor  and if that’s ok  check the throttle actuator motor in the throttle body. If those all check out  idle variations can be caused by unmetered air leaking into the intake manifold  and from fuel-evap systems problems. Poor control of fuel pressure should be considered too  although less likely.

It’s usually a sort of box- or cylinder- shaped gadget attached to the throttle body itself. You know where the throttle body is located  right? You’ll probably have to secure the service data  or find the info by googling. That type of info is usually contained in a Haynes or Chilton’s manual. Or there may be a related u-tube video somebody’s posted.

First thought that came to mind was the battery and alternator. My battery was old so I replaced it  but turns out the alternator was also busted (at least that’s what auto zone told me). Bought a new alternator and installed it. The issue is I’m an idiot and forgot to disconnect the batttery when I came back to tighten some things up and the wire with the nut on it touched some metal and sparked. Now the car starts and the battery light is off. But every other light is on  the radio is off  ac off  wipers and blinkers don’t work  and it won’t shift into gear. I checked most of he fuses and none of them are blown. Any ideas on what it could be? (Yes I know I’m an idiot for not disconnecting the battery)14

I pull one fuse as a time  examine it IN GOOD LIGHT  and if it’s fine  put it back. I had a similar situation with my 2006. Good luck.

They are not expensive to purchase. With the engine OFF  place the clip lead on a good metal ground point or the negative post of the battery. Place the tip of the probe on the main output post of the alternator and see if the light turns on. If it does not light then you need to find the blown fuse in the panel or the bad fusible link if there is one.

The car was in a fleet and I made it a point to pay attention to the car whenever I was at the business that owned the car and one day I saw the car enter the rear parking lot quite fast and turn into a downward sloping parking position and stop when it struck a high curb at 45* angle with the wheel turned to take the strike at the inside. I stopped and questioned the young lady driving the car and she was too rushed to talk to me. I spoke to the fleet manager and he found that the regular driver was doing an excellent job rushing somewhat critical samples and results to and from a lab. When I mentioned that the tie rod could fail totally and result in the car going out of control it was decided that a more convenient place to park was needed and with the car being parked parallel to the curb there were no more tie rod failures.I wonder if a similar situation commonly occurs with the OP?

This is the kind of info body shops use when they repair a wrecked vehicle. They’ll measure between two known reference points  and compare that to the spec. If it is incorrect they’ll take corrective action (usually involves bending something) to get it back to the correct distance. I expect that is the process your car needs. Assuming of course your shop is using the correct replacement parts. It’s pretty common here for posters to say they got the wrong dimension drive-shafts. Drive shaft length varies depending upon which transmission and engine is installed. But not so much for tie rods.

This would make the tire wobble side to side and over time could damage the tie rod connections. Ask a shop to measure the lateral (side to side) run-out of both front hubs. Good idea to check the vertical run out too.

You’ll need to test the line pressure. A full tank could be providing enough “head pressure” (from the weight of the gas) on the pump pickup to help it be able to maintain fuel flow  but ehen the tank gets low and the head pressure drops the pump is insuffciently strong to maintain presusure on its own.a saturated carbon canister. Your gas tank breaths in through the charcoal bed in the charcoal canister. If that’s saturated  it cannot do so and a vacuum can develop in the gas tank’s airspace as the pump draws the gas down  preventing the pump from pumping out fluid. This can lead to a failed pump. And it can be caused by “topping off” the gas tank…so if by chance you are doing this I’d recommend changing that practice.The problem is not the sending unit.

In my day letting a car with a sympton that was both so significant and easily duplicated get away from you not repaired was cause to hang you head in shame.I can’t imagine this happening. I have worked for people who would have fired me on the spot if I was not able to present a list of items that I had ruled out as being the cause of this condition.I can only attenuate my exasperation by relating that the car is an 1988 and perhaps all 3+ mechanics are used to having more help with the diagnosis. It is a shame these guys gave up so easily.

If it is a case of a blockage not allowing air into the tank as the fuel is used  you might try opening the gas cap. You may hear a rush of air into the tank. That would at least narrow the list of possible problems

A sender only provides a signal to the gas gauge; it does not have anything to do with the way the car runs.Other than a potential fuel pump issue  there are a number of things that could cause this. Idle Air Valve problem  failing ignition switch  problem in the spark ignition system  and while my memory on this is very hazy it seems to me this model used a deceleration fuel cut-off relay or module. Maybe this fuel cut-off is acting up. After 23 years and high miles it’s feasible anyway.

That eliminates the possibility that it is a pump  a pickup sock  or tubing inside the tank.Does this car have a ‘split’ fuel tank with half on either side of the spare tire cavity? If so  there must be some sort of mechanism for transferring fuel over to the fuel pump side when the tank is low. I would look at that transfer mechanism.

I have never written anything online before so please forgive me for not being as clear as I should have been…I really never thought anyone would read my note  let alone  answer it. The car stalls out when the fuel tank becomes half empty and yes  gets worse as more fuel is consumed. Slowing down doesn’t seem to cause a problem but coming to a hard stoop at the bottom of a hill will make it stall after braking. As for cloverleafs  I live in the boodocks and have only used two of them in past month and did not experience any problem. One mechanic wanted to replace  fuel pump and fuel tank…rather expensive so I elected to try car talk. Thank you for your help.

I had already changed the pcv valve in the front of the car before this occurred (that had thrown a p0455 code error ] I have heard this false rap about the fuel pump before and never found it to be the case. Its usually the carbon canister or the vent purge valve which is on top of the carbon canister. The reason the code doesn’t come on until the tank is about half full is because you have more vapors in the fuel tank at that point. When you fill up the gas tank  you remove the vapors. For one reason or another  your emissions system is not removing the vapors from the tank and the vacuum system is open all the time (a purge control valve stuck in open position) rather than being closed. I would first replace the purge control valve that sits on top of the carbon canister.

Some tests the car’s engine computer does only occur when certain parameters are met  and one of those is often how full the gas tank is. An evap system test might only be performed when the tank is half full  so that’s why the CEL only turns on then.

It was a change in something physical. The only physical change that happens when the tank reaches half full is that you now have many more vapors from fuel in the fuel tank. If the vent valve above the charcoal cannister is not operating correctly  the emissions are in an open circuit and can’t feed the computer correct information. ​

I have a 2016 Forester (2.5i Premium) and I have not noticed any AC issues. It seems perfectly normal to me. As a fellow Fozzy owner I offer these suggestions understanding you may already be doing it: Use a windshield sun shade to keep the car from heat-soaking in the sun. I find it makes a huge difference. If you are only going to be in a store a short time  point the back end at the sun and let the rear glass tint help. When rain is not an issue leave both rear windows cracked 2 inches to allow some heat to escape and also close your moonroof shade when you park.

Despite my earlier comment  I may have to agree. It was 92 yesterday here and the AC barely kept up in my 2016 Fozzy. Coincidentally  I have a 2018 VW Passat for testing. In back to back drives the Passat’s AC was significantly cooler coming out of the vents. I am thinking the Suby AC is just not as good. I may also ask that hte AC be tested at my next service visit. For the heck of it  I am also going to change the cabin air filter since it is so cheap and easy to do.

Maybe you just happened to get a flawed one.The Subarus I’ve owned (3 of them) have all ad pretty good A/C units.Makes me appreciate my Sonoma. A 100 degrees lately and putting out 28 degree air.

Burnt plastic kind of smell?Based on this  I’d guess you have a wire with burned insulation that is touching a ground when the engine shifts during a turn. I’d also suggest an engine mount has failed to allow this to happen. If the car has an automatic  start it  put it in drive  plant your foot hard on the brake and press lightly on the accelerator. The engine should move a little. If it moves a lot  or better yet dies and restarts  there is your problem.Search the wiring loom starting with the battery cable to the starter for the burnt spot. Look where the clearance reduces or the wiring stretches when under load. Good Luck!

Those systems often play havoc with the vehicle’s electrical circuitry and unless they are carefully removed and all disturbed connections found and carefully restored  the problems continue.If it is not a factory-installed system  I can understand the dealer is being presented with a problem they’re not familiar with  and have no responsibility for (unless they installed an aftermarket system on the car.)

Something must have been damaged during the steering column replacement to be causing this problem. Your good independent mechanic should be able to complete this repair.

The wheel speed sensors at each wheel should not cost anywhere near $500 on a Subaru. Since you didn’t mention a check engine light  there wouldn’t be any codes to read on a regular code reader. A high end mechanics code reader should read ABS codes though.I’m thinking brake light switch myself and that should only cost an arm  you get to keep the leg ;).

If not  fix that first. If that doesn’t solve it  then I’m thinking (guessing) there’s a problem with the brake pedal safety interlock. That’s used to prevent you (or your kids who’s left in the car while you get them a Big Gulp during a trip to 7-11) from shifting from P to D unless the brakes are applied.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,1,public_141714,Long story short: I want to lengthen the battery cables to accommodate a battery that has the terminals reversed. The negative cable looks especially difficult to replace with a longer cable because it snakes around the back of the engine.Yes  I know there are batteries with terminals in the correct positions. But I want this battery for a specific use  and the cables don’t reach.Are those battery cable splice kits OK for long-term use (as in  are they reliable over the long-haul)? The splicing mechanism seems essentially the same as these underground waterproof splices 5.I’ve searched extensively on the web and haven’t yet found anything conclusive to answer this question one way or the other.18
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,2,ledhed75,I’m really curious what your “specific use” is. Because this seems like an invitation to disaster.Based on my own experience  I know wacky things can happen when your battery/electrical systems aren’t totally 100% in sync.On the off chance that your van needs a jump start…are you going to be 100% vigilant that the “jumper” with the “donor” battery doesn’t reverse the polarity and fry your electronics?I’d really think hard about doing this.

124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,3,public_141714,Yeah [ I’m really curious what your “specific use” is. ] The specific use is that I’m installing a small solar system  and I need a battery with good reserve capacity.I don’t want an extra battery inside the vehicle  and I don’t have anywhere else to put a second battery.Thus  I want to replace the starter battery with a dual-purpose battery. I haven’t found one that has a good reserve capacity and reversed terminals  so I end up at a battery that has standard terminals.

This is something you may want to have an electrical shop do for you. The proper crimp tool needed for the job can be fairly expensive to purchase. A proper tape job will protect the connections.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,6,Mustangman,Far better to remove both cables and make new ones of the proper length with no splices. Solder lugs can be used  and I prefer them to crimp style. You have to remove the cables to solder them without burning the car down so why not just donthe job correctly?
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,7,ken2116,A proper  longer cable is your best option and a mechanic may be able to put it in in reasonable time if you can’t. Splicing is possible  also bolting to a properly sized terminal block  rated for cranking current and under hood environment. You might consult a welding equipment shop and/or electric car gurus as they deal with cables and currents of this size.Survey the physical environment of the new positive terminal position  whether the closed hood will touch or come close to it  what will happen if the battery shifts position  etc. - be sure the positive terminal is well insulated and clearly marked. Protect against over charging by the solar system. If the vented type  ensure the battery is well ventilated during solar charging as when parked there won’t be the airflow to carry off hydrogen as when driving. Due to design differences between utility and starting batteries you may need to check the battery acid level and add water (distilled or deionized) more frequently.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,8,Tester,If the battery you’re trying to adapt into this solar system is a starting battery  that’s the wrong type of battery for this application.Instead  you want to use a deep cycle battery.A starting battery has thin plates  and loses its charge rapidly. Starting battery’s aren’t designed to be deeply discharged. Starting battery’s require a long period of charging time to bring them back up to full charge.A deep cycle battery has thicker plates  This allows the battery to provide power over a longer period of time before requiring recharging. A deep cycle battery can be deeply discharged and recharged without doing damage to the battery. And a deep cycle battery takes a recharge very rapidly. That’s why they’re used in golf carts.So. It sounds like the battery requires replacement due to the application.Tester
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,9,It_s_Me,There’s also the marine starting deep cycle batteries AKA marine dual purpose.Usually used to start the gas engine and get you to your fishing spot  then shut off the gas engine and use your electric trolling motor and other electronics all day long  and then start your gas engine and go home at the end day all with one battery.Biggest problem I see with what the OP wants to do is will this battery even physically fit in the battery tray.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,10,public_141714,Thanks for all the input.I know that a true deep cycle is the best choice for a solar setup  but I definitely want a 1-battery system.I have not found a true deep cycle battery that:Fits.Has terminals on the correct side.Has enough CCA to start the car (3.3L engine  manufacturer recommends something like 620 CCA min).So  I’m looking at dual-purpose batteries. I have not found a dual-purpose battery with a decent reserve capacity that is the correct size and has the correct terminals (24R/F).The battery I like (which has the terminals on the wrong side) is a dual-purpose battery recommended for trolling / starting applications and has a large RC.The biggest problem is that it has terminals on the wrong side.The solar isn’t installed yet. The current battery requires replacing b/c 1) it’s worn out  and 2) it’s a standard starting battery that won’t work for my plans.@Mustangman  @ken2116To me  the negative battery cable looks like it’s more of a harness that goes to the back of the engine compartment with several leads going to different places in the engine compartment.Do you think a longer version of that cable can be manufactured easily? Or is it more a matter of adding an extension to a stock cable?Thanks for the terminal block idea. I’ll look into that. I think the main issue is the negative cable. The positive cable looks pretty straightforward and easy to replace with a longer version.@MustangmanI’ve read soldered connections are more brittle in this type of environment b/c they’re rigid and can’t flex with vibrations. Does your experience indicate otherwise?
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,11,public_141714,@ledhed75 brought up a really good point  though.While I would oversee any jumpstarting if I’m there  there may be times when I’m not there—such as if someone borrows the vehicle.It also occurred to me that a mechanic who’s not really paying attention might accidentally reconnect the battery incorrectly when I get the vehicle serviced.The consequences of this look pretty bad.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,12,Mustangman, [ Does your experience indicate otherwise? ] Yes. This is a battery cable  not an ordinary wire. The solder lugs are heated and solder is melted into the recess and the cable is plunged in. The solder doesn’t wick up the wire and make it stiff.As for making up a ground cable  it isn’t rocket science. The big wire gets lengthened as do the smaller ones. If those need to be spliced  OK  they aren’t carrying large amounts of current.

I searched a lot  but apparently not well enough.That may solve the problem.Thank you for all of your insights.
124303,https://community.cartalk.com/t/battery-cable-splice/124303,Battery cable splice,Maintenance/Repairs,||cougar||mercury||,14,ken2116,It sounds like you may have found a battery of the same configuration  will assume the cable issue is moot for now. If you haven’t already done so check it for fit  both size and terminal style.Check its chemistry and charging voltage requirements  all are some flavor of lead-acid but can vary a bit in maximum charging voltage spec. This one may be fine and at worst would need to adjust your voltage regulator or install a different one.Don’t forget fusing.If you’re going to be drawing on the battery with the car not running you’ll probably want an auto cut-off set for ~ 25% charge (so you can restart). Marine and RV vendors are sources.Remove metal jewelry and wear eye protection when working around batteries. Disconnect the ground first  reconnect it last (so when you’re wrenching the positive terminal or any lead and the tool touches ground your life doesn’t get too interesting).If you’re going to be drawing on the battery with the car not running you’ll probably want an auto cut-off set for ~ 25% charge (so you can restart). Marine and RV vendors are sources.Make sure nothing about your set up can interrupt the connection between battery and alternator while the car is running  the battery must remain connected when the engine is running to snub high voltage spikes originating from the alternator  to protect electronics  control modules  etc. Sparking carries this risk  too.

[ If you haven’t already done so check it for fit  both size and terminal style. ] Thx. I definitely will. It comes up as a “fit” for my vehicle in the product finder on various sites.I’ll have 15A fuses on both the connection from the solar charge controller and the battery  and on my load connections from the controller.I’m looking at battery monitors to protect against overcharging from the solar  and will have some sort of low voltage monitor and / or cutoff. My load is small; the battery is meant to be more of a fallback that I’ll use carefully. I read that these dual-purpose AGM batteries are drop-in replacements for flooded starter batteries and work with all modern alternators  but I’ll double-check. [ Make sure nothing about your set up can interrupt the connection between battery and alternator while the car is running  the battery must remain connected when the engine is running to snub high voltage spikes originating from the alternator  to protect electronics  control modules  etc. Sparking carries this risk  too. ] I didn’t know about the voltage spikes.

Deep-cycle batteries can be repeatedly discharged and recharged without causing damage or shortening their life.A dual purpose battery Is designed to do both  they usually don’t deliver the same cranking amps as a starting battery or the reserve capacity of a deep cycle. They also cost more.

That’s how it is designed to move.

124039,https://community.cartalk.com/t/trans-mount-deflection/124039,Trans mount deflection,Maintenance/Repairs,||equinox||chevrolet||,5,Cavell,You are not here. You cannot say part is working as designed. That it has not collapsed to point of transmitting vibration into cab.
124039,https://community.cartalk.com/t/trans-mount-deflection/124039,Trans mount deflection,Maintenance/Repairs,||equinox||chevrolet||,6,shadowfax,That’s right. We’re going on what you said  which is that you’re getting 1/2 to 3/4 inch deflection on the mount. Looking at the picture of the brand new mount  it’s obvious that’s the expected amount of deflection you will get on a working mount. So unless you are wrong  and you are getting a significantly different amount deflection than you think you are  then replacing the mount will be a waste of time and money because you will still have vibration at the end of it.…Actually  thinking about it  the deflection should mean you get less vibration. Stiffer mounts = more vibration. I got a free massage chair when I put poly mounts in my MR2.
124039,https://community.cartalk.com/t/trans-mount-deflection/124039,Trans mount deflection,Maintenance/Repairs,||equinox||chevrolet||,7,Cavell,i changed the ball joint and control arm bushing as they were ordered online and they are cheap. i would say the “noise” issue is better but i still feel something “moving”. there is a bigger mount under the battery tray. that mount is for the top of the trans and the mount i have pictured is for below that area. maybe 1ft away. maybe the battery mount has more impact on my issue? there are 3 on driver side. low front of motor/trans point  top of trans and bottom/back of trans. and only 1 on the pass sidei have had 2 other vues with the v6 but i only drove 1 for a few months. i had no issue with a similar vibration sensation on those. i am waiting on title from dmv for this equinox so i might drive it for a few months also. it might be ok thru the winter as i dont drive far and awd would be ok. but i dont see keeping it for long

I remember back in 1956 when I was in high school  the mechanic that serviced my parents’ cars had a 1942 Pontiac. One time when we visited his shop the Pontiac was up on blocks and he was parting it out. I had ridden in his car and it ran well. He explained to me that the floor pan had rusted through and it wasn’t worth fixing and this mechanic even did welding. He also told me when looking for an older used car  to first check for rust and stay away from a rusted vehicle. Back then a car that needed an engine was a simple problem compared to a car that ran well but was rusted

I also wish GM still made minivans. I need a minivan for transporting my fellow musicians and their instruments. No other vehicle will do this as conveniently as a minivan. I had a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander that I really liked. We sold it to our son who needed a better vehicle. That Uplander now has gone 200 000 miles without a major repair. I would have purchased another GM van but General Motors quit making minivans. The Chevrolet Traverse didn’t meet my needs. Hence  GM lost my business to Toyota. If Toyota and.other manufacturers can turn a profit making minivans  it seems odd that GM couldn’t do the same.

Some alloys are really good but very costly to purchase. You might find this inside a nuclear reactor but not on a consumer model vehicle.The stainless steel burners in my gas grills always seem to last a few years and then need to be replaced. Apparently that is an application where the cheap alloys used only last so long.I have scrapped some stainless in the past for money. The guys at the yard give a higher value for stainless that doesn’t attract a magnet vs. stainless that is magnetic. I have a buddy who is a machinist. They recycle all the cuttings/turnings as well. They get more since this is a very specialized and costly form of metal. It is medical grade and probably a lot better than anything in your tailpipe.It sounds like you made the best of this by trading it in for $1000. I think you did REALLY well on this one. Cars only last so long and I suspect this was used in a northern climate where they salt in the winter.

Bad connections caused by looseness or corrosion can do crazy things. I had a starting problem once  called AAA  and the tow truck driver disconnected the battery  cleaned them  reconnected  and it started like a champ. I felt like a goof but learned a lesson.I’m not much of a mechanic  but that’s the first thing I’d do. If that doesn’t work  then I’d listen to what other posters put up here and probably end up getting a mechanic to check it out.

If it doesn’t  you need to make sure the cable between positive battery and starter is clean on both ends  and is not damaged. Same for negative cable both ends. These are free fixes. If cables are good and clean  check starter. If starter is good the problem is in the primary circuit. Ignition switch  wiring relay solenoid. You bought an ignition switch not knowing if that was the problem. That can be an expensive habit. If ignition switch doesn’t do the trick  I would make SURE cablesare good. If they are  do what George San Jose 1 says. If that doesn’t work  take it to a shop  this is an easy diagnosis if a tech had the car in front of him.

If they are both above 10.5 volts and it doesn’t crank  replace the starter motor. If one or both isn’t  work from the starter toward the battery to find why not. Battery  battery connections  neutral safety switch  ignition switch  and security modules are common reasons for ‘fails to crank’.

Bought it used last year. Since I bought it  I’ve replaced the water pump  all coil packs/plugs/wires and a few other regular maintenance details. I drive 40 miles to work through the mountains. At about the 20 mile mark  the heat light for the transmission comes on and about 5 miles later  goes off. What is causing this and is it something I need to be worried about?12

Do you have or can your rent another vehicle until you know more? Is this a new problem or has it been occurring since you got the vehicle? Can you associate it with something that has changed (your route  load  ambient air temperature)? Have you checked both the ATF level and condition (color  smell)? Does driving in a different gear help?

It only started happening last week  I can probably get it into the mechanic next week. Its an automatic so the only gear I could shift to when it’s happening on the highway is 2nd  no way to test it shifting changes anything without shredding the transmission. Would adding fresh fluid buy me any time? Is there an easy way to drain some or do I have to do a full flush? If the fluid is okay  what else could be causing the issue? How much is this going to cost me  best case worst case  is what I’m trying to get at.
124134,https://community.cartalk.com/t/transmission-excessive-heat-light/124134,Transmission Excessive Heat Light,Maintenance/Repairs,||dodge||dakota||,7,Nevada_545,There may be a restriction in the transmission cooler  does this truck have the tow package with auxiliary cooler? You might consider replacing the radiator to be sure that the transmission cooler is working properly and performing a transmission service.
124134,https://community.cartalk.com/t/transmission-excessive-heat-light/124134,Transmission Excessive Heat Light,Maintenance/Repairs,||dodge||dakota||,8,ken2116,The fact that it’s a new event suggests something is changing for the worse  possibly in a hurry.Worst case is a transmission rebuild or replacement  easily several thousand $$ or more  more likely the longer you keep driving it. Suggest you park it until diagnosed by a qualified shop  the shop may offer a loaner or discounted rental which is excellent insurance at this stage. If you don’t have one  consult Car Talks “Mechanics Files” for recommended shops. If the shop is far away  tow it.Best case is the fluid just needs topping off  or replacement. It should be easy to check the level at home (there is a specific procedure  should be instructions in owners manual or a mechanic can do it) - do this today. If below the limit add a quarter or half qt. at a time  recheck  don’t over fill (low-to-full may be just 1pt.  if over full have the excess sucked out). If a change is needed take it to a qualified independent shop or dealership (not a chain  they’re often not well trained  might do anything  and often try to sell unneeded services). Use the approved fluid - vehicles are very specific and the wrong fluid can do damage. Transmissions seldom need after market additives - possible exception is for a minor leak and consult a Dodge dealer about what’s safe for that.There are other potential causes  some easily corrected and relatively inexpensive  if addressed asap.Does the transmission have a locking torque converter that should be disengaged while driving in the mountains? (Owners manual is your source.) One thing that overheats and wears transmissions is excessive shifting which can happen in the hills  so it may be better to go down a gear or two and control the shifting yourself. (See owners manual). Learn what the transmission actually does when you put the shifter in “2nd” (owners manual)  at higher speeds it may just shift down one gear such as from 5th (I believe your’s is a 5 sp.) to 4th  or from 4th to 3rd  working its way down as appropriate for your current speed. Most (maybe all) modern automatics won’t drop into too low a gear for the speed when shifted to 2nd. Learn the maximum speeds for each gear (owners manual).The fact that this just started happening is a big red flag (see Items 1 and 2). Take it seriously  best wishes  and let us know the outcome.

From what I see there’s a chance your truck sports a separate air-to-fluid trans cooler  located in front of the radiator. If so  that should be checked also. Verifying the radiator fins aren’t plugged up with bug debris  and that the radiator fans are working is common sense too.

Your problem may be relatively inexpensive to fix at this point but become very expensive very soon  especially given your 80mi. commute.

I have already covered a few maintenance items myself. Took it to a long trip  no problems. The car drives fine  but there is still one thing that is still bothering me.The car sounds like an electric vehicle as you accelerate or rev the engine in neutral or park. The noise comes from the passenger side area in the front of the vehicle. It doesn’t bother me that much as it is not too loud  and it kinda makes the car feel like a go kart  which is fun. You can’t hear the noise above 45+ mph or in the freeway  but then I thought the noise it was making might not be normal.I bought a stethoscope just for this  but couldn’t figure out exactly where the noise was coming from. As I opened the throttle  I could hear the noise was louder in both the power steering pump and the alternator using the stethoscope. The power steering pump sits right above the alternator in this car  so I don’t know if it is both parts that are bad or just one of them. What are the symptoms of either part failing?Power steering doesn’t make that loud whining/grinding type of noise when you turn the steering wheel. Power steering fluid is not leaking from the rack or anywhere else  but the fluid itself is dark. Turning the steering wheel makes a “rubbing” noise in the area around the steering wheel itself but there is no binding or anything  it feels normal.I already replaced the drive belt and both the idler pulley and the tensioner because both were visibly wobbling and felt gritty when spinning them. I spinned by hand both the alternator and the power steering pulleys and they seemed fine.Any help is appreciated. Thanks!11

I see people in the Saturn forums using either ATF or PS fluid in their Saturns  which is strange to me. The manual only specifies Saturn Power Steering fluid. I bought some Prestone Power Steering fluid but I am not sure.For the transaxle fluid for example; the manual says to use Saturn ATF fluid  but Dexron III can be used instead if Saturn fluid is not available. So I am guessing in the case of Saturn Power Steering fluid  regular Power Steering fluid can be used?Also… Can the alternator be tested in an auto parts store?

ATF works  too. The pumps whine like a 3 year old when the fluid gets nasty but also when the pump is on its way out. The hardest part in changing one is breaking the fluid lines free.Alternators can whine as well before they fail but I’d change the PS fluid first and see how that helps  if any. If I remember correctly (I owned a '93 SC2) removing the alternator is a bit of a pain. The alternator noise is a bearing issue  not usually an electrical one  so feeling for smooth rotation should tell you if its on the way out.

If you open the return line at the rack  most all of it will come out and then you can refill with ATF or PS fluid. [ It is quiet when you turn the steering wheel  it is quiet at idle too. ] Then that points to the alternator  IMHO.

124140,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2008-toyota-rav4-known-rear-differential-issue/124140,2008 Toyota RAV4: known rear differential issue,Maintenance/Repairs,||rav4||toyota||,1,ValerieLarson,I am writing as a follow up to an article published in the StarTribune in 2014 that I found among the many search results regarding a rear differential assembly issue on Toyota RAV4’s.Follow the StarTribune for the news  photos and videos from the Twin Cities and beyond.In February 2016 I was notified by Toyota of a known issue with the rear differential assembly on my Toyota 2008 RAV4  and that it was being covered by an extended warranty to “assure customer satisfaction” until April 30  2017. (Warranty Enhancement Notification – ZF4). In December of 2016 I took the vehicle to the local Toyota dealer for unrelated service  and while there  asked them to also inspect for the rear differential issue so that  if necessary  it could be addressed prior to the extended warranty expiring. I was told that even though the part is known to have an unacceptable failure rate  there isn’t a way to inspect it to determine whether it was failing. I was told I had to just wait to see if it failed. Naturally  it did fail  10 months after the extended warranty expiration date. Now I’m facing a costly repair for a part that is known by Toyota to not have an acceptable failure rate. If Toyota knows a part is not up to its reliability standards  but doesn’t want to do a recall  shouldn’t they repair all vehicle’s that it fails on if they truly want to “assure customer satisfaction”? I can understand not wanting to do a recall  after all  why replace the parts that don’t fail; but saying they will replace the defective part for owners that have theirs fail before a certain date  but for those of us that have it fail after that date it’s tough luck  is the exact opposite of assuring customer satisfaction. I contacted the Customer Experience Center as well as the executive offices at Toyota to discuss my concern  and requested that they at least cover a portion of the cost. I was told they “decline to offer assistance.” Nothing assures customer satisfaction quite like that. It feels like Toyota chose this extended warranty option  instead of a issuing recall  under the guise of doing something beneficial for their customers  when in reality they appear to be avoiding the cost of doing a recall on a faulty part. Maybe I’m just bitter. What are your thoughts regarding this practice by Toyota?3

To collect names off the internet to force Toyota into paying for your repair? Or to validate your complaint in your own mind?This is a nearly 11 year old car. If average mileage  it should have 132 000 miles. Toyota has to put a time frame on the repair or people will expect free service on this part forever. The part’s design target was not “forever.”That said  yes  I think Toyota should cover part of the cost but it doesn’t matter what I think. Your recourse is to claim you’d never buy a Toyota again. Which is  in itself  a disincentive to Toyota to pay for your fix. (Heck  she’s never buying one again  why should WE pay for it!) Your could sue Toyota for the repair. Lawyers cost money  you might lose. It may be less costly to just pay for the repair out of pocket. Sorry

You tried to get a reasonable accommodation  but Toyota wouldn’t go along. It seems like they could have done something - covered some of the expense or provided the next regular maintenance service or two free  you know  something. Tough to say whether Toyota had a bad practice. Some car companies wouldn’t have even done the extended warranty thing. From a company’s standpoint  they can’t have forever warranties. Sorry to ramble and not have a strong opinion either way  but I just don’t.
124140,https://community.cartalk.com/t/2008-toyota-rav4-known-rear-differential-issue/124140,2008 Toyota RAV4: known rear differential issue,Maintenance/Repairs,||rav4||toyota||,4,ValerieLarson,Thank you for your reply.I did already pay for the $2000 repair out of pocket last week  since compromising safety or reliability during an upcoming road trip isn’t worth the risk by delaying the repair to further discuss this with Toyota. I wasn’t asking them to cover the entire repair  but some sharing in the cost would certainly have been appreciated.I agree with everything you said  and I understand that whenever you buy something  whether it be a car  a computer  a boat  etc.  there is always the chance of a part randomly failing  and things are not built to last forever. My biggest issue with this is that it wasn’t a normal “random” chance of failure  the part is failing at an unacceptable rate. Plus I asked for their help to determine if mine was failing prior to the warranty expiration  and was told there wasn’t way to inspect it. (Is that true?) The gentleman from the Toyota executive office asked me if I had a way to prove I asked for their help  but since the service advisor didn’t write on the work order for the recall work I was in for  that he had advised me they couldn’t inspect the rear differential  he said I had no proof  even though he can clearly see that I came in for every recall in a timely manner  and was there for service on the day I noted on the warranty notice that I had asked about the differential (which fell between the date of the warranty notice and the warranty expiration) how likely is it that I wouldn’t have asked about this issue?You asked what my goal is with this request  and although some help from Toyota to cover the cost would certainly have been nice  at this point a public “shame on you” Toyota is about all I am hoping for.Best regards Val

For the radio problem you can either have the radio repaired or replace it with another similar unit. Ebay is a good place to get an OEM replacement for it. There are also places that repair radios. These kind of issues are just expected to come up with older used cars and you either put up with it  have the issues fixed  or purchase a newer car that has a warranty period on it. It is usually less expensive to keep a used car repaired rather than making monthly new car payments. Decisions that the owner has to take into account.

I still suspect that these issues may be due to other things  especially the radio tuning. If there is a problem within the BCM I would have to prove it first before replacing it. It is most likely pretty expensive to replace.
124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,1,wluu23,I have a '15 Fiat 500 Abarth automatic transmission that I drive with manual shifters 100% of the time with ESC off. After taking it the car to the dealership to replace the throttle body (they also updated the PCM) my car simply doesn’t run the same. It feels like a huge lost of power. At highway speed  I can no longer drop it to 5th and pass anyone up. When I do that at WOT the car or RPM no longer surges and it seems like there’s a rev limiter at about 3500 rpm. The car has been at the dealership for 2 weeks now and they insist the car drives fine even tho they acknowledge that the data proves otherwise. Anyways  long story short I took so log with the Torque App and saw somethings that I thought was unusual. So my questions are:Cruising at highway speed at about 75ish mph  2500 rpm  my throttle position is at WOT and the throttle body opening is at 25.5%. Is this correct?The throttle body data shows that it can only open 25.5% maximum. Is that correct? Shouldn’t it be 100% (or close to) if I’m at WOT?My pedal position is at around 30% and the throttle position is at WOT. Is this correct also?Thanks in advance for helping me. I just want to know if there is something unusual there and make sense of this. I know for sure my car definitely does not drive the same before taking it into the dealership. Maybe someone out there can educate me on how these devices work in relation to each other. I have researched hard on the internet and it only explains what the cars does at WOT and not in relation to the other devices (e.g. cruising at highway speed the throttle opening should be etc.)7
124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,2,Mustangman,No  that is not correct. If the throttle is at 100%  the throttle body should also be 100%No  that isn’t correct either  same reasonHuh?? That’s not right either. If it SHOWS 100% throttle body opening  is the car pulling like full throttle?Now I’m a big fan of Torque and use it quite a bit. Are you sure you are reading the right parameters for your car? The dealer’s thoughts seem contradictory - It can’t drive “fine” if they are feeling the same lack of power you are. It would seem as thought they need to possibly calibrate the throttle body to the ecu.
124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,3,wluu23,The dealership insist they done the throttle body calibration twice. In the Torque app  I’m selecting the highlighted green parameters only also I’m not selecting the measured value so I believe those are correct. I’m also using the Plugin App for Fiats. Here’s my 2 cents. These master tech at the dealership only knows how to remove and install stuff. When it comes to diagnosis  they suck! 2nd  he doesn’t even know how these car drives so what feels normal to him is subjective to whatever he is accustomed to. I know how my car pulls at what gears and at what conditions. I have escalated it up to corporate and the dealership said they will give them my log files. Crossing my fingers they look at it and come to the same conclusion as you did. Thanks! I’m gonna try to link my log files so people can see my data I gathered. The car is not even pulling WOT even tho it’s reporting that it is. That was what I also found odd!

124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,5,Mustangman,Yes. In the highest gear you might be at 25-40% throttle opening but not WOT at the throttle body nor the pedal output.Sorry to point out that these cars are at the bottom of many quality and reliability lists. Things like this might be why.
124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,6,wluu23,LOl no worries.

I’d find another dealership (with perhaps more competent mechanics) or escalate to zone rep for factory service help before I took a loss by trading it in. That just rewards apathy and/or incompetence…
124716,https://community.cartalk.com/t/power-loss-and-throttle-issues/124716,Power Loss and Throttle Issues,Maintenance/Repairs,||500||fiat||,8,wluu23,The car threw a P0122 Service ETC Throttle Body code and went into Limp Mode. Supposedly  this car has a known issue with throttle bodies malfunctioning. In the process they updated the PCM software and in that update it updated the compression parameters for start up issues and reverse light not turning on quick enough. That was what I was told by the “master” tech. Currently  I requested for it escalate up to corporate. If that fails  then I’ll take it to an independent Fiat specialist for diagnosis and repair and take the dealership to small claims to recuperate the cost. I simply don’t understand. It’s either they’re incompetent or ignorant. Its so obvious there is an issue and they even admit to it. SMH!

I was driving into work anr my engine started losing power tobthe point where it was shutting off and the battery light was flashing. I got to work and saw I had little to no oil so I put oil in ( I use synthetic) I have a flex pipe that needs repair. My car still continued to lose power so I used it to get home and didn’t drive anymore. Now when I start it  there is a noise. This noise hadn’t happened before and now the oil light is flashing as well. Could it be the oil pump? The weird thing is I didn’t run it for a few days and when I started it up the noise was not there until the vehicle started to warn up. I work on it myself. How do I diagnose and could there be a common reason why I have both power loss and now oil light?7

Neither will the water pump. That would result on the car overheating in very short order. You should have gotten red and yellow warning lights ALL over the dash for this and stopped driving immediately but you drove it home! You may now have blown head gaskets and a possibly damaged heads and/or block.Little to no oil… BIG problem  the engine may have been destroyed from lack of lubrication on the way to work but you drove it home. Flashing oil light means NO PRESSURE and you should have shut the engine down  but you started it up a few days later without determining what is wrong.You should find an actual mechanic to carefully check this car over to determine IF the engine can be salvaged but by the sounds of it  it is destroyed.

The tires are all at correct pressures.The Honda dealer insists that the problem is a faulty Mass Airflow Sensor. That sounds fishy to me  so I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks!3
124840,https://community.cartalk.com/t/could-a-mass-airflow-sensor-cause-all-these-lights/124840,Could a Mass Airflow Sensor cause all these lights?,Maintenance/Repairs,||fit||honda||,2,Mustangman,I can see how 1  4 and maybe even 3 could be affected by a bad or dirty MAF but 2? I’d suggest your Honda dealer will just add air to whatever tire is low to fix 2.If the CEL comes on  it often will throw the Stability Assist light since the ECu is compromised. The same might be the case for steering as well since it is electric uses information from the ECU to operate.If the dealer says its the MAF and that doesn’t fix all the lights  what is the downside? That you have something else that needs fixing that you need to pay for? Or is this still under warranty?
124840,https://community.cartalk.com/t/could-a-mass-airflow-sensor-cause-all-these-lights/124840,Could a Mass Airflow Sensor cause all these lights?,Maintenance/Repairs,||fit||honda||,3,VDCdriver,I can’t say that this is true for Hondas  but I can tell you that on late-model Subarus when the CEL turns on  all of the other warning lights will also turn on. This is because there is a fairly substantial portion of the population that believes it is normal for cars to have the CEL lit-up  and as a result they tend to ignore the CEL. Subaru believes that a “Christmas tree effect” will alarm people to the extent that they won’t ignore a problem  and will take the vehicle to a mechanic sooner  rather than later.To return to your question… yes  it is entirely possible that a defective MAF could cause all of this. If you doubt the dealership’s word  you could have the car’s OBD system checked–gratis–by the guys at Autozone  Advance Auto  O’Reilly  or (possibly) NAPA. The stored diagnostic trouble code(s) that they find will confirm or refute the MAF diagnosis.

The right rear line blew and I finally traced it to the proportioning valve port and ran a new line and spliced into the old where the line was still good. Yes  I used a union and doubled flared the fittings. Then when screwing the fittings back on the proportioning valve  another line broke because of corrosion. The Rendezvous  the way they are put together it is no easy feat to trace these brake lines out. Everything is so congested you can’t see anything even when laying under the vehicle. From reading another post here  I guess that the right rear and left front are connected together on one side of the proportioning valve and the left rear and right front are connected together on the other side. So it is a diagonal type of set-up correct? Well  I know where the right rear connects in the valve. The valve looks like this https://www.amazon.com/ACDelco-15835454-Original-Equipment-Proportioning/dp/B00554L5V4 6. There are 6 ports. 4 on top and two on the rear side of the valve. The right rear line connects to the left rear port of the valve. So then the left front line would connect to the left top port  correct? I need to know if this is correct because I can’t trace by sight. So I will just run new lines to the wheels if I know what ports they go to. Thanks for your help.2

We ordered a electronic rack and pinion for my new 2017 Charger Daytona and the parts manufacturers are not sending replacement parts til they have many requests what is going on? I can be without my car for months. It’s been over 4 weeks now.3

It could be that the casting supplier for the housing broke his mold  or the rack gear supplier can’t get the right steel or there was a fire at the assembly plant.Since no one carries any inventory anymore - because it is costly - the customer has to wait. And YOU as a parts customer  that already purchased a car  is LESS important that a car plant that would be shut down because of a parts shortage. Sorry.

It’s been over 4 weeks now. ] If you are not being provided with a FREE loaner car  then you should file a complaint with Chrysler at the corporate level. When a car that is still under warranty is inoperable  it is up to the vehicle mfr. to provide a free replacement vehicle for you when the car is laid-up for covered repairs.

I have listen to your radio show for years!! Completely baffled… The transmission slips in second but when you let up off the gas it goes into gear and keeps driving. I had the transmission replaced (against the advice of the transmission mechanic!) and still slips in 2nd!?! Not sure if this makes any difference but the problem started right after my neighborhood ‘mechanic’ replaced my fuel pump assembly and filter…?5

What were his thoughts on it slipping?

(Which it didn’t!) Took it to another local shop who had it for 7 full days and advised taking it to an electrical shop that “has tools GM doesn’t have” because they came up empty hand too!

GM built the car  the dealer has the tools to fix it. But other shops do  too. I’d suggest you go to a proper independent automotive shop with trained mechanics to look into this.Given that this is a 2000 model  I’m not sure I’d have spent the money for a transmission replacement. I think I’d have driven it to a junkyard and sold it to them.

But this car has been maintained by GM shop since day one. All preventive maintenance / parts done / replaced when it was recommended not when the parts went bad. (With GM parts by GM maintenance. ) Money just got super tight and tried other options. But hey…Thanks for the reply… Super helpful.

Transmission mechanic ? Neighborhood mechanic? GM?Was it a used or rebuilt transmission?Was Torque converter replaced?Any check/service engine lights on?

Taken it in to Ford 3 times. They diagnosed it for $500 but will need additional $2000 to fix. Seems outrageous for vehicle purchased new and has less than 50K miles. I found lots of similar complaints…what to do?1

So you are just going to need to find an independent air conditioner shop . That should be less expensive but still costly.
